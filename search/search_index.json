Tokens To access any of the token end points you will be required to authenticate using a token. Tokens can be created directly from within the LibreNMS web interface by going to /api-access/ . Click on 'Create API access token'. Select the user you would like to generate the token for. Enter an optional description. Click Create API Token. Endpoints Whilst this documentation will describe and show examples of the end points, we've designed the API so you should be able to traverse through it without knowing any of the available API routes. You can do this by first calling /api/v0 : curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0 Output: { \"list_bgp\" : \"https://librenms.org/api/v0/bgp\" , ... \"edit_rule\" : \"https://librenms.org/api/v0/rules\" } Input Input to the API is done in three different ways, sometimes a combination two or three of these. Passing parameters via the api route. For example when obtaining a devices details you will pass the hostname of the device in the route: /api/v0/devices/:hostname . Passing parameters via the query string. For example you can list all devices on your install but limit the output to devices that are currently down: /api/v0/devices?type=down Passing data in via JSON, this will mainly be used when adding or updating information via the API, for instance adding a new device: curl -X POST -d '{\"hostname\":\"localhost.localdomain\",\"version\":\"v1\",\"community\":\"public\"}'-H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0/devices Output Output from the API currently is via two output types: JSON Most API responses will output json.

The aim for that is, if all parent devices are down, alert contacts will not receive redundant alerts for dependent devices. This is very useful when you have an outage, say in a branch office, where normally you'd receive hundreds of alerts, but when this is properly configured, you'd only receive an alert for the parent hosts. There are three ways to configure this feature. First one is from general settings of a device. The other two can be done in the 'Device Dependencies' item under 'Devices' menu. In this page, you can see all devices and with its parents. Clicking on the 'bin' icon will clear the dependency setting. Clicking on the 'pen' icon will let you edit or change the current setting for chosen device. There's also a 'Manage Device Dependencies' button on the top.

Options Here are some of the other options available when adding an alerting rule: Rule name: The name associated with the rule. Severity: How \"important\" the rule is. Max alerts: The maximum number of alerts sent for the event. -1 means unlimited. Delay: The amount of time in seconds to wait after a rule is matched before sending an alert out transport. Interval: The interval of time in seconds between alerts for an event until Max alert is reached. Mute alerts: Disables sending alert rule through alert transport. But will still show the alert in the Web UI. Invert match: Invert the matching rule (ie. alert on items that _don't match the rule). Recovery alerts: This will disable the recovery notification from being sent if turned off. Advanced On the Advanced tab, you can specify some additional options for the alert rule: Override SQL: Enable this if you using a custom query Query: The query to be used for the alert. An example of this would be an average rule for all CPUs over 10% SELECT * , AVG ( processors . processor_usage ) as cpu_avg FROM devices , processors WHERE ( devices . device_id = ? AND devices . device_id = processors . device_id ) AND ( devices . status = 1 && ( devices . disabled = 0 && devices . ignore = 0 )) = 1 HAVING AVG ( processors . processor_usage ) > 10 The 10 would then contain the average CPU usage value, you can change this value to be whatever you like. You will to need copy and paste this into the Alert Rule under Advanced then paste into Query box and switch the Override SQL. Procedure You can associate a rule to a procedure by giving the URL of the procedure when creating the rule. Only links like \"http://\" are supported, otherwise an error will be returned. Once configured, procedure can be opened from the Alert widget through the \"Open\" button, which can be shown/hidden from the widget configuration box.

LibreNMS uses alert grouping by alert rule, which can produce an array of alerts of similar content for an array of hosts, whereas Alertmanager can group them by alert meta, ideally producing one single notice in case an issue occurs. It is possible to configure as much label values as required in Alertmanager Options section. Every label and it's value should be entered as a new line. Alertmanager Docs Example: Config Example Alertmanager URL http://alertmanager.example.com Alertmanager Options: source=librenms customlabel=value API The API transport allows to reach any service provider using POST, PUT or GET URLs (Like SMS provider, etc). It can be used in multiple ways: The same text built from the Alert template is available in the variable $msg , which can then be sent as an option to the API. Be carefull that HTTP GET requests are usually limited in length. The API-Option fields can be directly built from the variables defined in Template-Syntax but without the 'alert->' prefix. For instance, $alert->uptime is available as $uptime in the API transport The API-Headers allows you to add the headers that the api endpoint requires. The API-body allow sending data in the format required by the ApI endpoint. A few variables commonly used : Variable Description {{ $hostname }} Hostname {{ $sysName }} SysName {{ $sysDescr }} SysDescr {{ $os }} OS of device (librenms defined) {{ $type }} Type of device (librenms defined) {{ $ip }} IP Address {{ $hardware }} Hardware {{ $version }} Version {{ $uptime }} Uptime in seconds {{ $uptime_short }} Uptime in human-readable format {{ $timestamp }} Timestamp of alert {{ $description }} Description of device {{ $title }} Title (as built from the Alert Template) {{ $msg }} Body text (as built from the Alert Template) Example: The example below will use the API named sms-api of my.example.com and send the title of the alert to the provided number using the provided service key.

IRC The IRC transports only works together with the LibreNMS IRC-Bot. Configuration of the LibreNMS IRC-Bot is described here . Example: Config Example IRC enabled JIRA You can have LibreNMS create issues on a Jira instance for critical and warning alerts. The Jira transport only sets summary and description fields. Therefore your Jira project must not have any other mandatory field for the provided issuetype. The config fields that need to set are Jira URL, Jira username, Jira password, Project key, and issue type. Currently http authentication is used to access Jira and Jira username and password will be stored as cleartext in the LibreNMS database.

The provided Auth_token belongs to an user, which is member of this room. The Message, sent to the matrix-room can be built from the variables defined in Template-Syntax but without the 'alert->' prefix. See API-Transport. The variable $msg is contains the result of the Alert template. The Matrix-Server URL is cutted before the beginning of the _matrix/client/r0/... API-part. Example: Config Example Matrix-Server URL https://matrix.example.com/ Room !ajPbbPalmVbNuQoBDK:example.com Auth_token: MDAyYmxvY2F0aW9uI...z1DCn6lz_uOhtW3XRICg Message: Alert: {{ $msg }} https://librenms.example.com Microsoft Teams LibreNMS can send alerts to Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhooks which are then posted to a specific channel. Microsoft recommends using markdown formatting for connector cards. Administrators can opt to compose the MessageCard themselves using JSON to get the full functionality. Example: Config Example WebHook URL https://outlook.office365.com/webhook/123456789 Use JSON? x Nagios Compatible The nagios transport will feed a FIFO at the defined location with the same format that nagios would. This allows you to use other alerting systems with LibreNMS, for example Flapjack . Example: Config Example Nagios FIFO /path/to/my.fifo OpsGenie Using OpsGenie LibreNMS integration, LibreNMS forwards alerts to OpsGenie with detailed information. OpsGenie acts as a dispatcher for LibreNMS alerts, determines the right people to notify based on on-call schedules and notifies via email, text messages (SMS), phone calls and iOS & Android push notifications. Then escalates alerts until the alert is acknowledged or closed. Create a LibreNMS Integration from the integrations page once you signup. Then copy the API key from OpsGenie to LibreNMS. If you want to automatically ack and close alerts, leverage Marid integration. More detail with screenshots is available in OpsGenie LibreNMS Integration page . Example: Config Example WebHook URL https://url/path/to/webhook osTicket LibreNMS can send alerts to osTicket API which are then converted to osTicket tickets. Example: Config Example API URL http://osticket.example.com/api/http.php/tickets.json API Token 123456789 PagerDuty LibreNMS can make use of PagerDuty, this is done by utilizing an API key and Integraton Key. API Keys can be found under 'API Access' in the PagerDuty portal. Integration Keys can be found under 'Integration' for the particular Service you have created in the PagerDuty portal. Example: Config Example API Key randomsample Integration Key somerandomstring Philips Hue Want to spice up your noc life?

Firstly you need to create a new Application (called LibreNMS, for example) in your account on the Pushover website ( https://pushover.net/apps ). Now copy your API Key and obtain your User Key from the newly created Application and setup the transport. Pushover Docs Example: Config Example Api Key APPLICATIONAPIKEYGOESHERE User Key USERKEYGOESHERE Pushover Options sound_critical=falling sound_warning=siren sound_ok=magic Rocket.chat The Rocket.chat transport will POST the alert message to your Rocket.chat Incoming WebHook using the attachments option. Simple html tags are stripped from the message. All options are optional, the only required value is for url, without this then no call to Rocket.chat will be made. Rocket.chat Docs Example: Config Example Webhook URL https://rocket.url/api/v1/chat.postMessage Rocket.chat Options channel=#Alerting username=myname icon_url=http://someurl/image.gif icon_emoji=:smirk: Sensu The Sensu transport will POST an Event to the Agent API upon an alert being generated. It will be categorised (ok, warning or critical), and if you configure the alert to send recovery notifications, Sensu will also clear the alert automatically. No configuration is required - as long as you are running the Sensu Agent on your poller with the HTTP socket enabled on tcp/3031, LibreNMS will start generating Sensu events as soon as you create the transport. Acknowledging alerts within LibreNMS is not directly supported, but an annotation ( acknowledged ) is set, so a mutator or silence, or even the handler could be written to look for it directly in the handler. There is also an annotation ( generated-by ) set, to allow you to treat LibreNMS events differently from agent events. The 'shortname' option is a simple way to reduce the length of device names in configs. It replaces the last 3 domain components with single letters (e.g. websrv08.dc4.eu.corp.example.net gets shortened to websrv08.dc4.eu.cen). Limitations Only a single namespace is supported Sensu will reject rules with special characters - the Transport will attempt to fix up rule names, but it's best to stick to letters, numbers and spaces The transport only deals in absolutes - it ignores the got worse/got better states The agent will buffer alerts, but LibreNMS will not - if your agent is offline, alerts will be dropped There is no backchannel between Sensu and LibreNMS - if you make changes in Sensu to LibreNMS alerts, they'll be lost on the next event (silences will work) Example: Config Example Sensu Endpoint http://localhost:3031 Sensu Namespace eu-west Check Prefix lnms Source Key hostname Slack The Slack transport will POST the alert message to your Slack Incoming WebHook using the attachments option, you are able to specify multiple webhooks along with the relevant options to go with it.

To do this click on the following url: https://telegram.me/botfather Generate a new bot with the command \"/newbot\" BotFather is then asking for a username and a normal name. After that your bot is created and you get a HTTP token. (for more options for your bot type \"/help\") Add your bot to telegram with the following url: http://telegram.me/<botname> to use app or https://web.telegram.org/<botname> to use in web, and send some text to the bot. The BotFather should have responded with a token, copy your token code and go to the following page in chrome: https://api.telegram.org/bot<tokencode>/getUpdates (this could take a while so continue to refresh until you see something similar to below) You see a json code with the message you sent to the bot. Copy the Chat id. In this example that is \u201c-9787468\u201d within this example: \"message\":{\"message_id\":7,\"from\":\"id\":656556,\"first_name\":\"Joo\",\"last_name\":\"Doo\",\"username\":\"JohnDoo\"},\"chat\":{\"id\":-9787468,\"title\":\"Telegram Group\"},\"date\":1435216924,\"text\":\"Hi\"}}]} . Now create a new \"Telegram transport\" in LibreNMS (Global Settings -> Alerting Settings -> Telegram transport). Click on 'Add Telegram config' and put your chat id and token into the relevant box. If want to use a group to receive alerts, you need to pick the Chat ID of the group chat, and not of the Bot itself.

Much of the Laravel documentation applies: https://laravel.com/docs/structure Directories from the (filtered) structure tree below are some of the directories that will be most interesting during development: . \u251c\u2500 app \u251c\u2500 database \u2502 \u2514\u2500 migrations \u251c\u2500 doc \u251c\u2500 html \u2502 \u251c\u2500 css \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 custom \u2502 \u2514\u2500 js \u251c\u2500 includes \u2502 \u251c\u2500 definitions \u2502 \u251c\u2500 discovery \u2502 \u251c\u2500 html \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 forms \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 graphs \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 pages \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 reports \u2502 \u2514\u2500 polling \u251c\u2500 LibreNMS \u251c\u2500 logs \u251c\u2500 mibs \u2514\u2500 rrd doc/ This is the location of all the documentation for LibreNMS, this is in GitHub markdown format and can be viewed online app/ Most Laravel and Eloquent classes should be under this directory. LibreNMS/ Classes that don't belong to the Laravel application belong in this directory, with a directory structure that matches the namespace. One class per file. See PSR-0 for details. html/ All legacy web accessible files are located here. New pages should follow the Laravel conventions. html/api_v0.php This is the API routing file which directs users to the correct API function based on the API endpoint call. html/index.php This is the main file which all links within LibreNMS are parsed through. It loads the majority of the relevant includes needed for the control panel to function. CSS and JS files are also loaded here. html/css/ All used CSS files are located here. html/css/custom/ This is a directory you can put custom css files into that won't interfere with auto updates html/js/ All used JS files are located here. includes/ This directory is quite big and contains all the files to make the cli and polling / discovery to work. This code is not currently accessible from Laravel code (intentionally). includes/discovery/, includes/polling/ All the discovery and polling code. The format is usually quite similar between discovery and polling. Both are made up of modules and the files within the relevant directories will match that module. So for instance if you want to update the os detection for a device, you would look in includes/discovery/os/ for a file named after the operating system such as linux: includes/discovery/linux.inc.php . Within here you would update or add support for newer OS'. This is the same for polling as well. includes/html/ This is where the majority of the website core files are located. These tend to be files that contain functions or often used code segments that can be included where needed rather than duplicating code. includes/html/forms/ This directory contains all of the files that are dynamically included from an ajax call to ajax/form. includes/html/api_functions.inc.php All of the functions and calls for the API are located here. includes/html/functions.inc.php This contains the majority of functions used throughout the standard web ui. includes/html/graphs/ This directory contains global and OS specific graph definitions. includes/html/reports/ In here is a list of of files that generate PDF reports available to the user. These are dynamically called in from html/pdf.php based on the report the user requests. includes/html/table/ This directory contains all of the ajax calls when generating the table of data. Most have been converted over so if you are planning to add a new table of data then you will do so here for all of the back end data calls. includes/html/pages/ This directory contains the URL structure when browsing the Web UI. So for example /devices/ is actually a call to includes/html/pages/devices.inc.php , /device/tab=ports/ is includes/html/pages/device/ports.inc.php . logs/ Contains the main librenms.log file by default, but can also contain your web server's logs, poller logs, and other items. mibs/ Here is where all of the mibs are located. Generally standard mibs should be in the root directory and specific vendor mibs should be in their own subdirectory. rrd/ Simple enough, this is where all of the rrd files are created. They are stored in directory based on the device hostname. database/migrations Contains all the database migrations.

To agree with these assertions, when you submit your first pull request you will be asked after submitting to sign the CLA, you do this by following the link provided in the PR and agreeing to the CLA using your GitHub account. Local patches Please note that the above contributor agreement means that if you have developed a feature for a non-GPL version of Observium, we can't include it in LibreNMS, even if you have not released it to the public. If there's a feature you use to which this applies, please document its functionality in an issue, and we'll do our best to include equivalent functionality in LibreNMS.

If you use code from somewhere else, even if it's trivial, be sure to note this as a comment in the code (preferably) or the commit message. Accurate attribution is crucial to our success as a Free Software project. For any dependency Include its name, source URL, copyright notice, and license in doc/General/Credits.md To add a php dependency, please use composer Add the dependency composer require slim/slim Updating php dependencies Update dependencies FORCE=1 php56 ./scripts/composer_wrapper.php update Commit the updated composer.lock file To add a javascript dependency Where possible please include minimized libraries in the html/js/ folder. Don't submit code whose license conflicts with the GPLv3. If you're not sure, consult the Free Software Foundation's license list and see if your code's license is on the compatible or incompatible list. If you prefer a non-copyleft license, Apache 2.0 is the recommended choice as per the FSF guidelines. The current Observium license is incompatible with GPLv3. Don't submit code from current Observium unless you are the copyright holder, and you specifically state in the code that you are releasing it under GPLv3 (or a compatible license). Because contributing to Observium requires that you reassign copyright to Adam Armstrong, if you want to release the same code for both Observium and LibreNMS, you need to release it for LibreNMS first and mark it with your own copyright notice, then release it to Observium and remove your copyright, granting Adam ownership. Please note that the above is necessary even if you don't care about keeping the copyright to your code, because otherwise we could be accused of misappropriating Observium's code.

In this example, we will add a new OS called test-os using the device ID 101 that has already been added. It will be of the type network and belongs to the vendor, Cisco: ./scripts/new-os.php -h 101 -o test-os -t network -v cisco The process will then step you through the process with some more questions. Please be warned, this is currently pre-beta and may cause some issues.

If you want to help develop LibreNMS and haven't really used Git before then this quick primer will help you get started. Some assumptions: Work is being done on a Linux box. LibreNMS is to be installed in /opt/librenms You have git installed. You have a GitHub Account . You are using ssh to connect to GitHub (If not, replace git@github.com:/yourusername/librenms.git with https://github.com/yourusername/librenms.git . Replace yourusername with your GitHub username. Fork LibreNMS repo You do this directly within GitHub , click the 'Fork' button near the top right. If you are associated with multiple organisations within GitHub then you might need to select which account you want to push the fork to. Prepare your git environment These are the defaults that are recommended. git config branch.autosetupmerge true git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com Clone the repo Ok so now that you have forked the repo, you now need to clone it to your local install where you can then make the changes you need and submit them back. cd /opt/ git clone git@github.com:/yourusername/librenms.git Add Upstream repo To be able to pull in changes from the master LibreNMS repo you need to have it setup on your system. git remote add upstream https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git Now you have two configured remotes: origin: This is your repository, you can push and pull changes here. upstream: This is the main LibreNMS repository and you can only pull changes. Workflow guide As you become more familiar you may find a better workflow that fits your needs, until then this should be a safe workflow for you to follow. Before you start work on a new branch / feature. Make sure you are up to date. cd /opt/librenms git checkout master git pull upstream master git push origin master At this stage it's worth pointing out that we have some standard checks that are performed when you submit a pull request, you can run these checks yourself to be sure no issues are present in your pull request. Now, create a new branch to do you work on. It's important that you do this as you are then able to work on more than one feature at a time and submit them as pull requests individually. If you did all your work in the master branch then it gets a bit messy! You need to give your branch a name. If an issue is open (or closed on GitHub) then you can use that, in this example if the issue number is 123 then we will use issue-123. If a post exists on the community forum then you can use the post id like community-123.

Please note that DISPLAY-HINTS are disabled so ensure you use the correct divisor / multiplier if applicable. All yaml files are located in includes/definitions/discovery/$os.yaml . Defining the information here is not always possible and is heavily reliant on vendors being sensible with the MIBs they generate. Only snmp walks are supported and you must provide a sane table that can be traversed and contains all of the data you need. We will use netbotz as an example here. includes/definitions/discovery/netbotz.yaml mib : NETBOTZV2-MIB modules : sensors : airflow : options : skip_value_lt : 0 data : - oid : airFlowSensorTable value : airFlowSensorValue divisor : 10 num_oid : '.1.3.6.1.4.1.5528.100.4.1.5.1.2.{{ $index }}' descr : '{{ $airFlowSensorLabel }}' index : 'airFlowSensorValue.{{ $index }}' At the top you can define one or more mibs to be used in the lookup of data: mib: NETBOTZV2-MIB For use of multiple MIB files separate them with a colon: mib: NETBOTZV2-MIB:SECOND-MIB For data: you have the following options: The only sensor we have defined here is airflow. The available options are as follows: oid (required): This is the name of the table you want to do the snmp walk on. value (optional): This is the key within the table that contains the value. If not provided willuse oid num_oid (required): This is the numerical OID that contains value . This should always include {{ $index }} . snmptranslate -On can help figure out the number. In case the index is a string, {{ $index_string }} can be used instead. divisor (optional): This is the divisor to use against the returned value . multiplier (optional): This is the multiplier to use against the returned value . low_limit (optional): This is the critical low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. low_warn_limit (optional): This is the warning low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. warn_limit (optional): This is the warning high threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. high_limit (optional): This is the critical high threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. descr (required): The visible label for this sensor. It can be a key with in the table or a static string, optionally using {{ index }} . group (optional): Groups sensors together under in the webui, displaying this text. Not specifying this will put the sensors in the default group. index (optional): This is the index value we use to uniquely identify this sensor. {{ $index }} will be replaced by the index from the snmp walk. skip_values (optional): This is an array of values we should skip over (see note below). skip_value_lt (optional): If sensor value is less than this, skip the discovery. skip_value_gt (optional): If sensor value is greater than this, skip the discovery. entPhysicalIndex (optional): If the sensor belongs to a physical entity then you can specify the index here. entPhysicalIndex_measured (optional): If the sensor belongs to a physical entity then you can specify the entity type here. user_func (optional): You can provide a function name for the sensors value to be processed through (i.e. Convert fahrenheit to celsius use fahrenheit_to_celsius ) For options: you have the following available: divisor : This is the divisor to use against the returned value . multiplier : This is the multiplier to use against the returned value . skip_values : This is an array of values we should skip over (see note below). skip_value_lt : If sensor value is less than this, skip the discovery. skip_value_gt : If sensor value is greater than this, skip the discovery. Multiple variables can be used in the sensors definition. The syntax is {{ $variable }} . Any oid in the current table can be used, as well as pre_cached data. The index ($index) and the sub_indexes (in case the oid is indexed multiple times) are also available: if $index=\"1.20\", then $subindex0=\"1\" and $subindex1=\"20\". skip_values can also compare items within the OID table against values. The index of the sensor is used to retrieve the value from the OID, unless a target index is appended to the OID. Comparisons behave on a logical OR basis when chained, so only one of them needs to be matched for that particular sensor to be skipped during discovery. An example of this is below: skip_values : - oid : sensUnit op : '!=' value : 4 - oid : sensConfig.0 op : '!=' value : 1 op can be any of the following operators : =, !=, ==, !==, <=, >=, <, >, starts, ends, contains, regex, in_array, not_starts, not_ends, not_contains, not_regex, not_in_array, exists Example: skip_values : - oid : sensorName op : 'not_in_array' value : [ 'sensor1' , 'sensor2' ] skip_values : - oid : sensorOptionalOID op : 'exists' value : false If you aren't able to use yaml to perform the sensor discovery, you will most likely need to use Advanced health discovery. Advanced health discovery If you can't use the yaml files as above, then you will need to create the discovery code in php. The directory structure for sensor information is includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php . The format of all of the sensors follows the same code format which is to collect sensor information via SNMP and then call the discover_sensor() function; with the exception of state sensors which requires additional code. Sensor information is commonly found in an ENTITY mib supplied by device's vendor in the form of a table. Other mib tables may be used as well. Sensor information is first collected by includes/discovery/sensors/pre_cache/$os.inc.php . This program will pull in data from mib tables into a $pre_cache array that can then be used in includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php to extract specific values which are then passed to discover_sensor() . discover_sensor() Accepts the following arguments: &$valid = This is always $valid['sensor'], do not pass any other values. $class = Required. This is the sensor class from the table above (i.e humidity). $device = Required. This is the $device array. $oid = Required. This must be the numerical OID for where the data can be found, i.e .1.2.3.4.5.6.7.0 $index = Required. This must be unique for this sensor class, device and type. Typically it's the index from the table being walked or it could be the name of the OID if it's a single value. $type = Required. This should be the OS name, i.e pulse. $descr = Required. This is a descriptive value for the sensor. Some devices will provide names to use. $divisor = Defaults to 1. This is used to divided the returned value. $multiplier = Defaults to 1. This is used to multiply the returned value. $low_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low threshold limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $low_warn_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low warning limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report near out of range sensors. $warn_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the high warning limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report near out of range sensors. $high_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the high limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $current = Defaults to null. Can be used to set the current value on discovery. Poller will update this on the next poll cycle anyway. $poller_type = Defaults to snmp. Things like the unix-agent can set different values but for the most part this should be left as snmp. $entPhysicalIndex = Defaults to null. Sets the entPhysicalIndex to be used to look up further hardware if available. $entPhysicalIndex_measured = Defaults to null. Sets the type of entPhysicalIndex used, i.e ports. $user_func = Defaults to null. You can provide a function name for the sensors value to be processed through (i.e. Convert fahrenheit to celsius use fahrenheit_to_celsius ) $group = Defaults to null. Groups sensors together under in the webui, displaying this text. For the majority of devices, this is all that's required to add support for a sensor. Polling is done based on the data gathered using discover_sensor() . If custom polling is needed then the file format is similar to discovery: includes/polling/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php . Whilst it's possible to perform additional snmp queries within polling this should be avoided where possible. The value for the OID is already available as $sensor_value . Graphing is performed automatically for sensors, no custom graphing is required or supported. Adding a new sensor class You will need to add code for your new sensor class in the following existing files: app/Models/Sensor.php : add a free icon from Font Awesome in the $icons array. doc/Developing/os/Health-Information.md : documentation for every sensor class is mandatory. includes/discovery/sensors.inc.php : add the sensor class to the $run_sensors array. includes/discovery/functions.inc.php : optional - if sensible low_limit and high_limit values are guessable when a SNMP-retrievable threshold is not available, add a case for the sensor class to the sensor_limit() and/or sensor_low_limit() functions. LibreNMS/Util/ObjectCache.php : optional - choose menu grouping for the sensor class. includes/html/pages/device/health.inc.php : add a dbFetchCell(), $datas[], and $type_text[] entry for the sensor class. includes/html/pages/device/overview.inc.php : add require 'overview/sensors/$class.inc.php' in the desired order for the device overview page. includes/html/pages/health.inc.php : add a $type_text[] entry for the sensor class. resources/lang/en/sensors.php : add human-readable names and units for the sensor class in English, feel free to do so for other languages as well.

In this example we will be collecting optical power level (dBm) from Adva FSP150CC family MetroE devices. This example will assume an understanding of SNMP and MIBs. First we setup includes/discovery/sensors/pre_cache/adva_fsp150.inc as shown below. The first line walks the cmEntityObject table to get information about the chassis and line cards. From this information we extract the model type which will identify which tables in the CM-Facility-Mib the ports are populated in. The program then reads the appropriate table into the $pre_cache array adva_fsp150_ports . This array will have OID indexies for each port, which we will use later to identify our sensor OIDs. $pre_cache['adva_fsp150'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEntityObjects', [], 'CM-ENTITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); $neType = $pre_cache['adva_fsp150'][1]['neType']; if ($neType == 'ccxg116pro') { $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); } else { $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetNetPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetAccPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); } Next we are going to build our sensor discovery code. These are optical readings, so the file will be created as the dBm sensor type in includes/discover/sensors/dbm/adva_fsp150.inc.php . Below is a snippet of the code: foreach ($pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] as $index => $entry) { if ($entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortMediaType'] == 'fiber') { //Discover received power level $oidRx = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.2544.1.12.5.1.21.1.34.' . $index . '.3'; $oidTx = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.2544.1.12.5.1.21.1.33.' . $index .

AND `device_id` = ?', [$entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex'], $device['device_id']]) . ' Rx Power'; discover_sensor( $valid['sensor'], 'dbm', $device, $oidRx, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortStatsOPR.' . $index, 'adva_fsp150', $descrRx, $divisor, $multiplier, null, null, null, null, $currentRx, 'snmp', $entPhysicalIndex, $entPhysicalIndex_measured ); $descrTx = dbFetchCell('SELECT `ifName` FROM `ports` WHERE `ifIndex`= ?

In the case of Advas, the ports are names Ethernet 1-1-1-1, 1-1-1-2, etc, and they are indexed as oid.1.1.1.1, oid.1.1.1.2, etc in the mib. Next the program checks which table the port exists in and that the connector type is 'fiber'. There are other port tables in the full code that were ommitted from the example for brevity. Copper media won't have optical readings, so if the media type isn't fiber we skip discovery for that port. The next two lines build the OIDs for getting the optical receive and transmit values using the $index for the port. Using the OIDs the program gets the current receive and transmit values ($currentRx and $currentTx repectively) to verify the values are not 0. Not all SFPs collect digital optical monitoring (DOM) data, in the case of Adva the value of both transmit and recieve will be 0 if DOM is not available. While 0 is a valid value for optical power, its extremely unlikely that both will be 0 if DOM is present. If DOM is not available, then the program stops discovery for that port. Note that while this is the case with Adva, other vendors may differ in how they handle optics that do not supply DOM. Please check your vendor's mibs. Next the program assigns the values of $entPhysicalIndex and $entPhysicalIndex_measured. In this case $entPhysicalIndex is set to the value of the cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex so that it is associated with port. This will also allow the sensor graphs to show up on the associated port's page in the GUI in addition to the Health page. Following that the program uses a database call to get the description of the port which will be used as the title for the graph in the GUI. Lastly the program calls discover_sensor() and passes the information collected in the previous steps. The null values are for low, low warning, high, and high warning values, which are not collected in the Adva's MIB. You can manually run discovery to verify the code works by running ./discovery.php -h $device_id -m sensors . You can use -v to see what calls are being used during discovery and -d to see debug output. In the output under #### Load disco module sensors #### you can see a list of sensors types. If there is a + a sensor is added, if there is a - one was deleted, and a . means no change. If there is nothing next to the sensor type then the sensor was not discovered.

Defining the information here is not always possible and is heavily reliant on vendors being sensible with the MIBs they generate. Only snmp walks are supported and you must provide a sane table that can be traversed and contains all of the data you need.

In case the index is a string, {{ $index_string }} can be used instead. divisor (optional): This is the divisor to use against the returned value . multiplier (optional): This is the multiplier to use against the returned value . low_limit (optional): This is the critical low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. low_warn_limit (optional): This is the warning low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. warn_limit (optional): This is the warning high threshold that value should be (used in alerting).

Multiple variables can be used in the sensors definition. The syntax is {{ $variable }} . Any oid in the current table can be used, as well as pre_cached data. The index ($index) and the sub_indexes (in case the oid is indexed multiple times) are also available: if $index=\"1.20\", then $subindex0=\"1\" and $subindex1=\"20\". skip_values can also compare items within the OID table against values. The index of the sensor is used to retrieve the value from the OID, unless a target index is appended to the OID. Comparisons behave on a logical OR basis when chained, so only one of them needs to be matched for that particular sensor to be skipped during discovery. An example of this is below: skip_values : - oid : sensUnit op : '!=' value : 4 - oid : sensConfig.0 op : '!=' value : 1 op can be any of the following operators : =, !=, ==, !==, <=, >=, <, >, starts, ends, contains, regex, in_array, not_starts, not_ends, not_contains, not_regex, not_in_array, exists Example: skip_values : - oid : sensorName op : 'not_in_array' value : [ 'sensor1' , 'sensor2' ] skip_values : - oid : sensorOptionalOID op : 'exists' value : false If you aren't able to use yaml to perform the sensor discovery, you will most likely need to use Advanced health discovery.","title":"Simple health discovery"},{"location":"Developing/os/Health-Information/#advanced-health-discovery","text":"If you can't use the yaml files as above, then you will need to create the discovery code in php. The directory structure for sensor information is includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php . The format of all of the sensors follows the same code format which is to collect sensor information via SNMP and then call the discover_sensor() function; with the exception of state sensors which requires additional code. Sensor information is commonly found in an ENTITY mib supplied by device's vendor in the form of a table. Other mib tables may be used as well. Sensor information is first collected by includes/discovery/sensors/pre_cache/$os.inc.php . This program will pull in data from mib tables into a $pre_cache array that can then be used in includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php to extract specific values which are then passed to discover_sensor() . discover_sensor() Accepts the following arguments: &$valid = This is always $valid['sensor'], do not pass any other values. $class = Required. This is the sensor class from the table above (i.e humidity). $device = Required. This is the $device array. $oid = Required. This must be the numerical OID for where the data can be found, i.e .1.2.3.4.5.6.7.0 $index = Required. This must be unique for this sensor class, device and type. Typically it's the index from the table being walked or it could be the name of the OID if it's a single value. $type = Required. This should be the OS name, i.e pulse. $descr = Required. This is a descriptive value for the sensor. Some devices will provide names to use. $divisor = Defaults to 1. This is used to divided the returned value. $multiplier = Defaults to 1. This is used to multiply the returned value. $low_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low threshold limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $low_warn_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low warning limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report near out of range sensors. $warn_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the high warning limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report near out of range sensors. $high_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the high limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $current = Defaults to null. Can be used to set the current value on discovery. Poller will update this on the next poll cycle anyway. $poller_type = Defaults to snmp. Things like the unix-agent can set different values but for the most part this should be left as snmp. $entPhysicalIndex = Defaults to null.

Groups sensors together under in the webui, displaying this text. For the majority of devices, this is all that's required to add support for a sensor. Polling is done based on the data gathered using discover_sensor() . If custom polling is needed then the file format is similar to discovery: includes/polling/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php .

From this information we extract the model type which will identify which tables in the CM-Facility-Mib the ports are populated in.

When replacing data, make sure it is modified in a consistent manner. We utilise snmpsim to do unit testing. For OS discovery, we can mock snmpsim, but for other tests you will need it installed and functioning. We run snmpsim during our integration tests, but not by default when running ./lnms dev:check . You can install snmpsim with the command pip3 install snmpsim . Capturing test data If test data already exists If test data already exists, but is for a different device/configuration with the same OS. Then you should use the --variant (-v) option to specify a different variant of the OS, this will be tested completely separate from other variants. If there is only one variant, please do not specify one. 1. Collect SNMP data ./scripts/collect-snmp-data.php is provided to make it easy to collect data for tests. Running collect-snmp-data.php with the --hostname (-h) allows you to capture all data used to discover and poll a device already added to LibreNMS. Make sure to re-run the script if you add additional support. Check the command-line help for more options. 2. Save test data After you have collected snmp data, run ./scripts/save-test-data.php with the --os (-o) option to dump the post discovery and post poll database entries to json files. This step requires snmpsim, if you are having issues, the maintainers may help you generate it from the snmprec you created in the previous step. Generally, you will only need to collect data once. After you have the data you need in the snmprec file, you can just use save-test-data.php to update the database dump (json) after that. Running tests Note: To run tests, ensure you have executed ./scripts/composer_wrapper.php install from your LibreNMS root directory. This will read composer.json and install any dependencies required. After you have saved your test data, you should run ./lnms dev:check verify they pass.

Different applications support a variety of ways to collect data: 1) by direct connection to the application, 2) snmpd extend, or 3) the agent . The monitoring of applications could be added before or after the hosts have been added to LibreNMS. If multiple methods of collection are listed you only need to enable one. SNMP Extend When using the snmp extend method, the application discovery module will pick up which applications you have set up for monitoring automatically, even if the device is already in LibreNMS. The application discovery module is enabled by default for most *nix operating systems, but in some cases you will need to manually enable the application discovery module. SUDO One major thing to keep in mind when using SNMP extend is these run as the snmpd user that can be an unprivileged user. In these situations you need to use sudo. To test if you need sudo, first check the user snmpd is running as. Then test if you can run the extend script as that user without issue. For example if snmpd is running as 'Debian-snmp' and we want to run the extend for proxmox, we check that the following run without error: sudo -u Debian-snmp /usr/local/bin/proxmox If it doesn't work, then you will need to use sudo with the extend command. For the example above, that would mean adding the line below to the sudoers file: Debian-snmp ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/proxmox Finally we would need to add sudo to the extend command, which would look like that for proxmox: extend proxmox /usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/bin/proxmox Enable the application discovery module Edit the device for which you want to add this support Click on the Modules tab and enable the applications module. This will be automatically saved, and you should get a green confirmation pop-up message. After you have enabled the application module, it would be wise to then also enable which applications you want to monitor, in the rare case where LibreNMS does not automatically detect it. Note : Only do this if an application was not auto-discovered by LibreNMS during discovery and polling. Enable the application(s) to be discovered Go to the device you have just enabled the application module for. Click on the Applications tab and select the applications you want to monitor. This will also be automatically saved, and you should get a green confirmation pop-up message. Agent The unix-agent does not have a discovery module, only a poller module. That poller module is always disabled by default. It needs to be manually enabled if using the agent. Some applications will be automatically enabled by the unix-agent poller module. It is better to ensure that your application is enabled for monitoring. You can check by following the steps under the SNMP Extend heading.

In case you get a Permission Denied error, make sure you changed the ownership correctly. 5: Also be aware that this file is appended to each time rndc stats is called. Given this it is suggested you setup file rotation for it. Alternatively you can also set zero_stats to 1 in the config. 6: The script for this also requires the Perl module File::ReadBackwards . FreeBSD => p5-File-ReadBackwards CentOS/RedHat => perl-File-ReadBackwards Debian/Ubuntu => libfile-readbackwards-perl If it is not available, it can be installed by cpan -i File::ReadBackwards . 7: You may possibly need to configure the agent/extend script as well. The config file's path defaults to the same path as the script, but with .config appended. So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/bind , the config file will be /etc/snmp/bind.config . Alternatively you can also specify a config via -c $file . Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables are $variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabs at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Content of an example /etc/snmp/bind.config . Please edit with your own settings. rndc = The path to rndc. Default: /usr/bin/env rndc call_rndc = A 0/1 boolean on whether or not to call rndc stats. Suggest to set to 0 if using netdata. Default: 1 stats_file = The path to the named stats file. Default: /var/cache/bind/stats agent = A 0/1 boolean for if this is being used as a LibreNMS agent or not. Default: 0 zero_stats = A 0/1 boolean for if the stats file should be zeroed first.

Under Ubuntu/Debian just run apt install python3-requests 2: Run chmod +x /etc/snmp/seafile.py 3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add: extend seafile /etc/snmp/seafile.py 4: You will also need to create the config file, which is named seafile.json . The script has to be located at /etc/snmp/. {\"url\": \"https://seafile.mydomain.org\", \"username\": \"some_admin_login@mail.address\", \"password\": \"password\", \"account_identifier\": \"name\" \"hide_monitoring_account\": true } The variables are as below. url = Url how to get access to Seafile Server username = Login to Seafile Server. It is important that used Login has admin privileges. Otherwise most API calls will be denied. password = Password to the configured login. account_identifier = Defines how user accounts are listed in RRD Graph. Options are: name, email hide_monitoring_account = With this Boolean you can hide the Account which you use to access Seafile API Note: It is recommended to use a dedicated Administrator account for monitoring. SMART SNMP Extend Copy the Perl script, smart, to the desired host. wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/smart -O /etc/snmp/smart Run chmod +x /etc/snmp/smart Edit your snmpd.conf file and add: extend smart /etc/snmp/smart You will also need to create the config file, which defaults to the same path as the script, but with .config appended. So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/smart, the config file will be /etc/snmp/smart.config . Alternatively you can also specific a config via -c . Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables is $variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabes at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Any line with out a matched variable or # are treated as a disk. #This is a comment cache=/var/cache/smart smartctl=/usr/bin/env smartctl useSN=1 ada0 ada1 da5 /dev/da5 -d sat twl0,0 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,0 twl0,1 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,1 twl0,2 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,2 The variables are as below. cache = The path to the cache file to use. Default: /var/cache/smart smartctl = The path to use for smartctl. Default: /usr/bin/env smartctl useSN = If set to 1, it will use the disks SN for reporting instead of the device name. 1 is the default. 0 will use the device name. A disk line is can be as simple as just a disk name under /dev/. Such as in the config above The line \"ada0\" would resolve to \"/dev/ada0\" and would be called with no special argument. If a line has a space in it, everything before the space is treated as the disk name and is what used for reporting and everything after that is used as the argument to be passed to smartctl. If you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks it should be. Restart snmpd on your host If you have a large number of more than one or two disks on a system, you should consider adding this to cron. Also make sure the cache file is some place it can be written to. */3 * * * * /etc/snmp/smart -u If your snmp agent runs as user \"snmp\", edit your sudo users (usually visudo ) and add at the bottom: snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/smart, /usr/bin/env smartctl and modify your snmpd.conf file accordingly: extend smart /usr/bin/sudo /etc/snmp/smart The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of the page. If it is not, please follow the steps set out under SNMP Extend heading top of page. If you set useSN to 1, it is worth noting that you will loose history(not able to access it from the web interface) for that device each time you change it. You will also need to run camcontrol or the like on said server to figure out what device actually corresponds with that serial number. Also if the system you are using uses non-static device naming based on bus information, it may be worthwhile just using the SN as the device ID is going to be irrelevant in that case.

Enable authentication module To enable a particular authentication module you need to set this up in config.php. Please note that only ONE module can be enabled. LibreNMS doesn't support multiple authentication mechanism at the same time. $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = \"mysql\" ; User levels and User account type 1: Normal User : You will need to assign device / port permissions for users at this level. 5: Global Read : Read only Administrator. 10: Administrator : This is a global read/write admin account. 11: Demo Account : Provides full read/write with certain restrictions (i.e can't delete devices). Note Oxidized configs can often contain sensitive data. Because of that only Administrator account type can see configs. Note for SELinux users When using SELinux on the LibreNMS server, you need to allow Apache (httpd) to connect LDAP/Active Directory server, this is disabled by default. You can use SELinux Booleans to allow network access to LDAP resources with this command: setsebool -P httpd_can_connect_ldap = 1 Testing authentication You can test authentication with this script: ./scripts/auth_test.php Enable debug output to troubleshoot issues MySQL Authentication Config option: mysql This is default option with LibreNMS so you should have already have the configuration setup in your environment file (.env). DB_HOST=HOSTNAME DB_DATABASE=DBNAME DB_USERNAME=DBUSER DB_PASSWORD=\"DBPASS\" Active Directory Authentication Config option: active_directory Install php_ldap or php7.0-ldap , making sure to install the same version as PHP. If you have issues with secure LDAP try setting $config['auth_ad_check_certificates'] to 0 , this will ignore certificate errors. Require actual membership of the configured groups If you set $config['auth_ad_require_groupmembership'] to 1, the authenticated user has to be a member of the specific group. Otherwise all users can authenticate, and will be either level 0 or you may set $config['auth_ad_global_read'] to 1 and all users will have read only access unless otherwise specified. Old account cleanup Cleanup of old accounts is done by checking the authlog. You will need to set the number of days when old accounts will be purged AUTOMATICALLY by daily.sh. Please ensure that you set the $config['authlog_purge'] value to be greater than $config['active_directory']['users_purge'] otherwise old users won't be removed. Sample configuration $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = 'active_directory' ; $config [ 'auth_ad_url' ] = 'ldaps://server.example.com' ; // Set server(s), space separated.

It is highly suggested to create a bind user, otherwise \"remember me\", alerting users, and the API will not work. Active Directory redundancy You can set two Active Directory servers by editing the $config['auth_ad_url'] like this example: $config['auth_ad_url'] = \"ldaps://dc1.example.com ldaps://dc2.example.com\"; Active Directory LDAP filters You can add an LDAP filter to be ANDed with the builtin user filter ( (sAMAccountName=$username) ). The defaults are: $config['auth_ad_user_filter'] = \"(objectclass=user)\"; $config['auth_ad_group_filter'] = \"(objectclass=group)\"; This yields (&(objectclass=user)(sAMAccountName=$username)) for the user filter and (&(objectclass=group)(sAMAccountName=$group)) for the group filter.

Useful if your users are in different OU. Bind username, if set, still user auth_ldap_suffix LDAP bind user (optional) If your ldap server does not allow anonymous bind, it is highly suggested to create a bind user, otherwise \"remember me\", alerting users, and the API will not work. $config [ 'auth_ldap_binduser' ] = 'ldapbind' ; // will use auth_ldap_prefix and auth_ldap_suffix #$config['auth_ldap_binddn'] = 'CN=John.Smith,CN=Users,DC=MyDomain,DC=com'; // overrides binduser $config [ 'auth_ldap_bindpassword' ] = 'password' ; LDAP server redundancy You can set two LDAP servers by editing the $config['auth_ldap_server'] like this example: $config['auth_ldap_server'] = \"ldaps://dir1.example.com ldaps://dir2.example.com\"; An example config setup for use with Jumpcloud LDAP as a service is: $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = \"ldap\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_version' ] = 3 ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_server' ] = \"ldap.jumpcloud.com\" ; #Set to ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com to enable LDAPS $config [ 'auth_ldap_port' ] = 389 ; #Set to 636 if using LDAPS $config [ 'auth_ldap_prefix' ] = \"uid=\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_suffix' ] = \",ou=Users,o={id},dc=jumpcloud,dc=com\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_groupbase' ] = \"ou=Users,o={id},dc=jumpcloud,dc=com\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_groupmemberattr' ] = \"member\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_groups' ] = [ '{group}' => [ 'level' => 10 ],]; $config [ 'auth_ldap_userdn' ] = true ; Replace {id} with the unique ID provided by Jumpcloud. Replace {group} with the unique group name created in Jumpcloud. This field is case sensitive. Note: If you have multiple user groups to define individual access levels replace the $config['auth_ldap_groups'] line with the following: $config [ 'auth_ldap_groups' ] = [ '{admin_group}' => [ 'level' => 10 ], '{global_readonly_group}' => [ 'level' => 5 ], ]; Radius Authentication Please note that a mysql user is created for each user the logs in successfully. User level 1 is assigned to those accounts so you will then need to assign the relevant permissions unless you set $config['radius']['userlevel'] to be something other than 1. $config [ 'radius' ][ 'hostname' ] = 'localhost' ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'port' ] = '1812' ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'secret' ] = 'testing123' ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'timeout' ] = 3 ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'users_purge' ] = 14 ; //Purge users who haven't logged in for 14 days. $config [ 'radius' ][ 'default_level' ] = 1 ; //Set the default user level when automatically creating a user. Old account cleanup Cleanup of old accounts is done by checking the authlog. You will need to set the number of days when old accounts will be purged AUTOMATICALLY by daily.sh. Please ensure that you set the $config['authlog_purge'] value to be greater than $config['radius']['users_purge'] otherwise old users won't be removed. HTTP Authentication Config option: http-auth LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already. At this stage it will need to assign a userlevel for that user which is done in one of two ways: A user exists in MySQL still where the usernames match up. A global guest user (which still needs to be added into MySQL: $config [ 'http_auth_guest' ] = \"guest\" ; This will then assign the userlevel for guest to all authenticated users. HTTP Authentication / AD Authorization Config option: ad-authorization This module is a combination of http-auth and active directory _ LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already (e.g. using Kerberos Authentication in Apache) but will use Active Directory lookups to determine and assign the userlevel of a user. The userlevel will be calculated by using AD group membership information as the active directory _ module does. The configuration is the same as for the active directory _ module with two extra, optional options: auth_ad_binduser and auth_ad_bindpassword. These should be set to a AD user with read capabilities in your AD Domain in order to be able to perform searches. If these options are omitted, the module will attempt an anonymous bind (which then of course must be allowed by your Active Directory server(s)). There is also one extra option for controlling user information caching: auth_ldap_cache_ttl. This option allows to control how long user information (user_exists, userid, userlevel) are cached within the PHP Session. The default value is 300 seconds. To disable this caching (highly discourage) set this option to 0. $config [ 'auth_ad_binduser' ] = \"ad_binduser\" ; $config [ 'auth_ad_bindpassword' ] = \"ad_bindpassword\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_cache_ttl' ] = 300 ; HTTP Authentication / LDAP Authorization Config option: ldap-authorization This module is a combination of http-auth and ldap LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already (e.g. using Kerberos Authentication in Apache) but will use LDAP to determine and assign the userlevel of a user. The userlevel will be calculated by using LDAP group membership information as the ldap module does. The configuration is the same as for the ldap module with one extra option: auth_ldap_cache_ttl. This option allows to control how long user information (user_exists, userid, userlevel) are cached within the PHP Session. The default value is 300 seconds. To disabled this caching (highly discourage) set this option to 0. $config [ 'auth_ldap_cache_ttl' ] = 300 ; View/embedded graphs without being logged into LibreNMS $config [ 'allow_unauth_graphs_cidr' ] = array ( '127.0.0.1/32' ); $config [ 'allow_unauth_graphs' ] = true ; Single Sign-on The single sign-on mechanism is used to integrate with third party authentication providers that are managed outside of LibreNMS - such as ADFS, Shibboleth, EZProxy, BeyondCorp, and others. A large number of these methods use SAML the module has been written assuming the use of SAML, and therefore these instructions contain some SAML terminology, but it should be possible to use any software that works in a similar way. In order to make use of the single sign-on module, you need to have an Identity Provider up and running, and know how to configure your Relying Party to pass attributes to LibreNMS via header injection or environment variables. Setting these up is outside of the scope of this documentation. As this module deals with authentication, it is extremely careful about validating the configuration - if it finds that certain values in the configuration are not set, it will reject access rather than try and guess. Basic Configuration To get up and running, all you need to do is configure the following values: $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = \"sso\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'mode' ] = \"env\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = \"static\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'static_level' ] = 10 ; This, along with the defaults, sets up a basic Single Sign-on setup that: Reads values from environment variables Automatically creates users when they're first seen Authomatically updates users with new values Gives everyone privilege level 10 This happens to mimic the behaviour of http-auth , so if this is the kind of setup you want, you're probably better of just going and using that mechanism. Security If there is a proxy involved (e.g. EZProxy, Azure AD Application Proxy, NGINX, mod_proxy) it's essential that you have some means in place to prevent headers being injected between the proxy and the end user, and also prevent end users from contacting LibreNMS directly. This should also apply to user connections to the proxy itself - the proxy must not be allowed to blindly pass through HTTP headers. mod security _ should be considered a minimum, with a full WAF being strongly recommended. This advice applies to the IDP too. The mechanism includes very basic protection, in the form of an IP whitelist with should contain the source addresses of your proxies: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'trusted_proxies' ] = [ '127.0.0.1/8' , '::1/128' , '192.0.2.0' , '2001:DB8::' ]; This configuration item should contain an array with a list of IP addresses or CIDR prefixes that are allowed to connect to LibreNMS and supply environment variables or headers. Advanced Configuration Options User Attribute If for some reason your relying party doesn't store the username in REMOTE USER _, you can override this choice. $config [ 'sso' ][ 'user_attr' ] = 'HTTP_UID' ; Note that the user lookup is a little special - normally headers are prefixed with HTTP_ , however this is not the case for remote user - it's a special case. If you're using something different you need to figure out of the HTTP_ prefix is required or not yourself. Automatic User Create/Update These are enabled by default: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'create_users' ] = true ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'update_users' ] = true ; If these are not enabled, user logins will be (somewhat silently) rejected unless an administrator has created the account in advance. Note that in the case of SAML federations, unless release of the users true identity has been negotiated with the IDP, the username (probably ePTID) is not likely to be predicable. Personalisation If the attributes are being populated, you can instruct the mechanism to add additional information to the user's database entry: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'email_attr' ] = \"mail\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'realname_attr' ] = \"displayName\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'descr_attr' ] = \"unscoped-affiliation Group Strategies Static As used above, static gives every single user the same privilege level. If you're working with a small team, or don't need access control, this is probably suitable. Attribute $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = \"attribute\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'level_attr' ] = \"entitlement\" ; If your Relying Party is capable of calculating the necessary privilege level, you can configure the module to read the privilege number straight from an attribute. sso level_attr should contain the name of the attribute that the Relying Party exposes to LibreNMS - as long as sso mode is correctly set, the mechanism should find the value. Group Map This is the most flexible (and complex) way of assigning privileges. $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = \"map\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_attr' ] = \"member\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_level_map' ] = [ 'librenms-admins' => 10 , 'librenms-readers' => 1 , 'librenms-billingcontacts' => 5 ]; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_delimiter' ] = ';' ; The mechanism expects to find a delimited list of groups within the attribute that sso group_attr _ points to. This should be an associative array of group name keys, with privilege levels as values. The mechanism will scan the list and find the highest privilege level that the user is entitled to, and assign that value to the user. This format may be specific to Shibboleth; other relying party software may need changes to the mechanism (e.g. mod auth_mellon _ may create pseudo arrays). There is an optional value for sites with large numbers of groups: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_filter' ] = \"/librenms-(.*)/i\" ; This filter causes the mechanism to only consider groups matching a regular expression. Logout Behaviour LibreNMS has no capability to log out a user authenticated via Single Sign-On - that responsability falls to the Relying Party. If your Relying Party has a magic URL that needs to be called to end a session, you can configure LibreNMS to direct the user to it: $config [ 'post_logout_action' ] = '/Shibboleth.sso/Logout' ; This option functions independantly of the Single Sign-on mechanism. Complete Configuration This configuration works on my deployment with a Shibboleth relying party, injecting environment variables, with the IDP supplying a list of groups. $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = 'sso' ; $config [ 'auth_logout_handler' ] = '/Shibboleth.sso/Logout' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'mode' ] = 'env' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'create_users' ] = true ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'update_users' ] = true ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'realname_attr' ] = 'displayName' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'email_attr' ] = 'mail' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = 'map' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_attr' ] = 'member' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_filter' ] = '/(librenms-.*)/i' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_delimiter' ] = ';' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_level_map' ] = [ 'librenms-demo' => 11 , 'librenms-globaladmin' => 10 , 'librenms-globalread' => 5 , 'librenms-lowpriv' => 1 ];","title":"Authentication Options"},{"location":"Extensions/Authentication/#authentication-modules","text":"LibreNMS supports multiple authentication modules along with Two Factor Auth .

All discovery methods run when discovery runs (every 6 hours by default and within 5 minutes for new devices). Please note that you need at least ONE device added before auto-discovery will work. The first thing to do though is add the required configuration options to config.php . SNMP Details To add devices automatically we need to know your snmp details, examples of SNMP v1, v2c and v3 are below: // v1 or v2c $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'community' ][] = \"my_custom_community\" ; $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'community' ][] = \"another_community\" ; // v3 $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'v3' ][ 0 ][ 'authlevel' ] = 'authPriv' ; $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'v3' ][ 0 ][ 'authname' ] = 'my_username' ; $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'v3' ][ 0 ][ 'authpass' ] = 'my_password' ; $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'v3' ][ 0 ][ 'authalgo' ] = 'MD5' ; $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'v3' ][ 0 ][ 'cryptopass' ] = 'my_crypto' ; $config [ 'snmp' ][ 'v3' ][ 0 ][ 'cryptoalgo' ] = 'AES' ; These details will be attempted when adding devices, you can specify any mixture of these. Allowed Networks Your Networks To add devices, we need to know what are your subnets so we don't go blindly attempting to add devices not under your control. $config [ 'nets' ][] = '192.168.0.0/24' ; $config [ 'nets' ][] = '172.2.4.0/22' ; Exclusions If you have added a network as above but a single device exists within it that you can't auto add, then you can exclude this with the following: $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'nets-exclude' ][] = '192.168.0.1/32' ; Additional Options Discovering devices by IP By default we don't add devices by IP address, we look for a reverse dns name to be found and add with that. If this fails and you would like to still add devices automatically then you will need to set $config['discovery_by_ip'] = true; Short hostnames If your devices only return a short hostname such as lax-fa0-dc01 but the full name should be lax-fa0-dc01.example.com then you can set $config['mydomain'] = 'example.com'; Allow Duplicate sysName By default we require unique sysNames when adding devices (this is returned over snmp by your devices). If you would like to allow devices to be added with duplicate sysNames then please set $config['allow_duplicate_sysName'] = true; . Discovery Methods Below are the methods for auto discovering devices. Each one can be enabled or disabled and may have additional configuration options. ARP Disabled by default. Adds devices that are listed in another device's arp table. This module depends on the arp-table module being enabled and returning data. To enable, switch on globally the $config['discovery_modules']['discovery-arp'] = true; or per device within the Modules section. XDP Enabled by default. $config['autodiscovery']['xdp'] = false; to disable. This includes FDP, CDP and LLDP support based on the device type. The LLDP/xDP links with neighbours will always be discovered as soon as the discovery module is enabled. However, LibreNMS will only try to add the new devices discovered with LLDP/xDP if $config['autodiscovery']['xdp'] = true ; Devices may be excluded from xdp discovery by sysName and sysDescr. //Exclude devices by name $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysname_regexp' ][] = '/host1/' ; $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysname_regexp' ][] = '/^dev/' ; //Exclude devices by description $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysdesc_regexp' ][] = '/Vendor X/' ; $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysdesc_regexp' ][] = '/Vendor Y/' ; Devices may be excluded from cdp discovery by platform. //Exclude devices by platform(Cisco only) $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'cdp_exclude' ][ 'platform_regexp' ][] = '/WS-C3750G/' ; These devices are excluded by default: $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysdesc_regexp' ][] = '/-K9W8-/' ; // Cisco Lightweight Access Point $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'cdp_exclude' ][ 'platform_regexp' ][] = '/^Cisco IP Phone/' ; //Cisco IP Phone OSPF Enabled by default. $config['autodiscovery']['ospf'] = false; to disable. BGP Enabled by default. $config['autodiscovery']['bgp'] = false; to disable. This module is invoked from bgp-peers discovery module. SNMP Scan Apart from the aforementioned Auto-Discovery options, LibreNMS is also able to proactively scan a network for SNMP-enabled devices using the configured version/credentials. SNMP Scan will scan $config['nets'] by default and respects $config['autodiscovery']['nets-exclude'] . To run the SNMP-Scanner you need to execute the snmp-scan.py from within your LibreNMS installation directory. Here the script's help-page for reference: usage: snmp-scan.py [-h] [-r NETWORK] [-t THREADS] [-l] [-v] Scan network for snmp hosts and add them to LibreNMS. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -r NETWORK CIDR noted IP-Range to scan.

The Driver behind this extension was to provide the features of ports, in a generic manner to discovery/poller modules. It provides a status (Nagios convention), the ability to Disable (do not poll), or Ignore (do not Alert). Database Structure The database structure contains the component table: mysql > select * from component limit 1 ; + ----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+ | id | device_id | type | label | status | disabled | ignore | error | + ----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+ | 9 | 1 | TEST | TEST LABEL | 0 | 1 | 1 | | + ----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) These fields are described below: id - ID for each component, unique index device_id - device_id from the devices table type - name from the component_type table label - Display label for the component status - The status of the component, retrieved from the device disabled - Should this component be polled? ignore - Should this component be alerted on error - Error message if in Alert state The component_prefs table holds custom data in an Attribute/Value format: mysql > select * from component_prefs limit 1 ; + ----+-----------+-----------+-----------+ | id | component | attribute | value | + ----+-----------+-----------+-----------+ | 4 | 9 | TEST_ATTR | TEST_ATTR | + ----+-----------+-----------+-----------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) Reserved Fields When this data from both the component and component_prefs tables is returned in one single consolidated array, there is the potential for someone to attempt to set an attribute (in the component_prefs ) table that is used in the component table. Because of this all fields of the component table are reserved, they cannot be used as custom attributes, if you update these the module will attempt to write them to the component table, not the component_prefs table. Using Components Create an instance of the component class: $COMPONENT = new LibreNMS\\Component (); Retrieving Components Now you can retrieve an array of the available components: $ARRAY = $COMPONENT -> getComponents ( $DEVICE_ID , $OPTIONS ); getComponents takes 2 arguments: DEVICE_ID or null for all devices. OPTIONS - an array of various options. getComponents will return an array containing components in the following format: Array ( [ X ] => Array ( [ Y1 ] => Array ( [ device_id ] => 1 [ TEST_ATTR ] => TEST_ATTR [ type ] => TEST [ label ] => TEST LABEL [ status ] => 0 [ ignore ] => 1 [ disabled ] => 1 [ error ] => ), [ Y2 ] => Array ( [ device_id ] => 1 [ TEST_ATTR ] => TEST_ATTR [ type ] => TESTING [ label ] => TEST LABEL [ status ] => 0 [ ignore ] => 1 [ disabled ] => 0 [ error ] => ), ) ) Where X is the Device ID and Y1/Y2 is the Component ID. In the example above, TEST_ATTR is a custom field, the rest are reserved fields. Options Options can be supplied to getComponents to influence which and how components are returned. Filtering You can filter on any of the reserved fields. Filters are created in the following format: $options [ 'filter' ][ 'FIELD' ] = array ( 'OPERATOR' , 'CRITERIA' ); Where: FIELD - The reserved field to filter on OPERATOR - 'LIKE' or '=', are we checking if the FIELD equals or contains the CRITERIA. CRITERIA - The criteria to search on There are 2 filtering shortcuts: $DEVICE_ID is a synonym for: $OPTIONS [ 'filter' ][ 'device_id' ] = array ( '=' , $DEVICE_ID ); $OPTIONS['type'] = $TYPE is a synonym for: $OPTIONS [ 'filter' ][ 'type' ] = array ( '=' , $TYPE ); Sorting You can sort the records that are returned by specifying the following option: $OPTIONS [ 'sort' ][ FIELD ] = 'DIRECTION' ; Where Direction is one of: ASC - Ascending, from Low to High DESC - Descending, from High to Low Creating Components To create a new component, run the createComponent function. $ARRAY = $COMPONENT -> createComponent ( $DEVICE_ID , $TYPE ); createComponent takes 2 arguments: DEVICE_ID - The ID of the device to attach the component to. TYPE - The unique type for your module. This will return a new, empty array with a component ID and Type set, all other fields will be set to defaults. Array ( [ 1 ] => Array ( [ type ] => TESTING [ label ] => [ status ] => 1 [ ignore ] => 0 [ disabled ] => 0 [ error ] => ) ) Deleting Components When a component is no longer needed, it can be deleted. $COMPONENT -> deleteComponent ( $COMPONENT_ID ) This will return True on success or False on failure. Editing Components To edit a component, the procedure is: Get the Current Components Edit the array Write the components Edit the Array Once you have a component array from getComponents the first thing to do is extract the components for only the single device you are editing. This is required because the setComponentPrefs function only saves a single device at a time. $ARRAY = $COMPONENT -> getComponents ( $DEVICE_ID , $OPTIONS ); $ARRAY = $ARRAY [ $DEVICE_ID ]; Then simply edit this array to suit your needs. If you need to add a new Attribute/Value pair you can: $ARRAY [ COMPONENT_ID ][ 'New Attribute' ] = \"Value\" ; If you need to delete a previously set Attribute/Value pair you can: unset ( $ARRAY [ COMPONENT_ID ][ 'New Attribute' ]); If you need to edit a previously set Attribute/Value pair you can: $ARRAY [ COMPONENT_ID ][ 'Existing Attribute' ] = \"New Value\" ; Write the components To write component changes back to the database simply: $COMPONENT -> setComponentPrefs ( $DEVICE_ID , $ARRAY ) When writing the component array there are several caveats to be aware of, these are: $ARRAY must be in the format of a single device ID - $ARRAY[$COMPONENT_ID][Attribute] = 'Value'; NOT in the multi device format returned by getComponents - $ARRAY[$DEVICE_ID][$COMPONENT_ID][Attribute] = 'Value'; You cannot edit the Component ID or the Device ID reserved fields can not be removed if a change is found an entry will be written to the eventlog. API Component details are available via the API. Please see the API-Docs for details. Alerting It is intended that discovery/poller modules will detect the status of a component during the polling cycle. Status is logged using the Nagios convention for status codes, where: 0 = Ok, 1 = Warning, 2 = Critical If you are creating a poller module which can detect a fault condition simply set STATUS to something other than 0 and ERROR to a message that indicates the problem. To actually raise an alert, the user will need to create an alert rule. To assist with this several Alerting Macro's have been created: %macro.component_normal - A component that is not disabled or ignored and in a Normal state. %macro.component_warning - A component that is not disabled or ignored and NOT in a Warning state. %macro.component_critical - A component that is not disabled or ignored and NOT in a Critical state. To raise alerts for components, the following rules could be created: %macros.component_critical = \"1\" - To alert on all Critical components %macros.component_critical = \"1\" && %component.type = \"<Type of Component>\" - To alert on all Critical components of a particular type. If there is a particular component you would like excluded from alerting, simply set the ignore field to 1.

You can share dashboards with other users. You can also make a custom dashboard and default it for all users in LibreNMS. Example Dashboard Widgets LibreNMS has a whole list of Widgets to select from. Alerts Widget: Displays all alert notifications. Availability Map: Displays all devices with colored tiles, green up, yellow for warning (device has been restarted in last 24 hours),red for down. You can also list all services and ignored/disabled devcies in this widget. Componet Status: List all componets Ok state, Warning state, Critical state. Device Summary horizontal: List device totals, up, down, ignored, disabled. Same for ports and services. Device Summary vertical: List device totals, up, down, ignored, disabled. Same for ports and services. Eventlog: Displays all events with your devices and LibreNMS. External Image: can be used to show external images on your dashboard. Or images from inside LibreNMS. Globe Map: Will display map of the globe. Graph: Can be used to display graphs from devices. Graylog: Displays all Graylog's syslog entries. Notes: use for html tags, embed links and external web pages. Or just notes in general. Server Stats: Will display gauges for CPU, Memory, Storage usage. Note the device type has to be listed as \"Server\". Syslog: Displays all syslog entries. Top Devices: By Traffic, or Uptime, or Response time, or Poller Duration, or Procssor load, or Memory Usage, or Storage Usage. Top Interfaces: Lists top interfaces by traffic utilization. Worldmap: displays all your devices locations. From syslocation or from override sysLocation. List of Widgets: Dashboard Permissions Private: Sets the dashabord to only the user that created the dashboard can view and edit. Shared Read: Sets the dashboard to allow other users to view the dashboard, but cant make changes to the dashboard. Shared: Allows all users to view the dashboard and make changes. Setting a global default dashboard Step 1: Set the dashboard to either shared read or shared, depending on what you want the users access to change. Step 2: Then go to Settings -> WebUI settings -> Dashboard Settings and set the global default dashboard. Setting embeded webpage Using the Notes Widget. < iframe src = \"your_url\" frameBorder = \"0\" width = \"100%\" height = \"100%\" > < p > Your browser does not support iframes. </ p > </ iframe > Note you may need to play with the width and height and also size your widget properly. src=\"url\" needs to be URL to webpage your linking to.

It does not replace the php scripts, just the cron entries running them. External Requirements A recent version of Python The LibreNMS service requires Python 3 and some features require behaviour only found in Python3.4+. Python modules PyMySQL is recommended as it requires no C compiler to install. MySQLclient can also be used, but does require compilation. python-dotenv .env loader redis-py 3.0+ and Redis 5.0+ server (if using distributed polling) psutil These can be obtained from your OS package manager, or from PyPI with the below commands. pip3 install -r requirements.txt Redis (distributed polling) If you want to use distributed polling, you'll need a Redis instance to coordinate the nodes. It's recommended that you do not share the Redis database with any other system - by default, Redis supports up to 16 databases (numbered 0-15). You can also use Redis on a single host if you want It's strongly recommended that you deploy a resilient cluster of redis systems, and use redis-sentinel. You should not rely on the password for the security of your system. See https://redis.io/topics/security Memcached (distributed polling) LibreNMS still uses memcached for locking daily update processes when using distributed polling. So you will still need to configure memcached unless you have updates disabled. MySQL You should already have this, but the pollers do need access to the SQL database. The LibreNMS service runs faster and more aggressively than the standard poller, so keep an eye on the number of open connections and other important health metrics. Configuration Connection settings are required in .env . The .env file is generated after composer install and APP_KEY and NODE_ID are set. Remember that the APP_KEY value must be the same on all your pollers. #APP_KEY= #Required, generated by composer install #NODE_ID= #Required, generated by composer install DB_HOST=localhost DB_DATABASE=librenms DB_USERNAME=librenms DB_PASSWORD= Distributed Polling Configuration Once you have your Redis database set up, configure it in the .env file on each node.

The closer the values are to each other, the flatter the CPU graph of the poller machine. Meaning that you are utilizing your CPU resources well. As long as Consumed WS stays below Maximum WS and Devices Pending is 0, you should be ok. If Consumed WS is below Maximum WS and Devices Pending is > 0, your hardware is not up to the task. Maximum WS equals the number of workers multiplied with the number of seconds in the polling period. (default 300) Fast Ping The fast ping scheduler is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting the following: $config [ 'service_ping_enabled' ] = true ; Watchdog The watchdog scheduler is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting the following: $config [ 'service_watchdog_enabled' ] = true ; The watchdog scheduler will check that the poller log file has been written to within the last poll period. If there is no change to the log file since, the watchdog will restart the polling service. The poller log file is set by $config['log_file'] and defaults to ./logs/librenms.log Cron Scripts Once the LibreNMS service is installed, the cron scripts used by LibreNMS are no longer required and must be removed. Service Installation A systemd unit file is provided - the sysv and upstart init scripts could also be used with a little modification. systemd A systemd unit file can be found in misc/librenms.service .

Distributed polling is not intended for remote polling. Devices can be grouped together into a poller_group to pin these devices to a single or a group of designated pollers. All pollers need to write to the same set of RRD files, preferably via RRDcached. It is a requirement that all pollers can access the central memcached to communicate with each other. Requirements These requirements are above the normal requirements for a full LibreNMS install. rrdtool version 1.4 or above Python 3 python-memcached package a memcached install a rrdcached install By default, all hosts are shared and have the poller_group = 0 . To pin a device to a poller, set it to a value greater than 0 and set the same value in the poller's config with $config['distributed_poller_group'] . One can also specify a comma separated string of poller groups in $config['distributed_poller_group']. The poller will then poll devices from any of the groups listed. If new devices get added from the poller they will be assigned to the first poller group in the list unless the group is specified when adding the device. A standard configuration for a distributed poller would look like: // Distributed Poller-Settings $config [ 'distributed_poller' ] = true ; // optional: defaults to hostname #$config['distributed_poller_name'] = 'custom'; $config [ 'distributed_poller_group' ] = 0 ; $config [ 'distributed_poller_memcached_host' ] = 'example.net' ; $config [ 'distributed_poller_memcached_port' ] = '11211' ; Example Setup Below is an example setup based on a real deployment which at the time of writing covers over 2,500 devices and 50,000 ports. The setup is running within an OpenStack environment with some commodity hardware for remote pollers. Here's a diagram of how you can scale LibreNMS out: Architecture How you setup the distribution is entirely up to you, you can choose to host the majority of the required services on a single virtual machine or server and then a poller to actually query the devices being monitored all the way through to having a dedicated server for each of the individual roles. Below are notes on what you need to consider both from the software layer but also connectivity. Web / API Layer This is typically Apache but we have setup guides for both Nginx and Lighttpd which should work perfectly fine. There is nothing unique about the role this service is providing except that if you are adding devices from this layer then the web service will need to be able to connect to the end device via SNMP and perform an ICMP test. It is advisable to run RRDCached within this setup so that you don't need to share the rrd folder via a remote file share such as NFS. The web service can then generate rrd graphs via RRDCached. If RRDCached isn't an option then you can mount the rrd directory to read the RRD files directly. Database Server MySQL / MariaDB - At the moment these are the only database servers that are supported. The pollers, web and API layers should all be able to access the database server directly. RRD Storage Central storage should be provided so all RRD files can be read from and written to in one location. As suggested above, it's recommended that RRD Cached is configured and used. For this example, we are running RRDCached to allow all pollers and web/api servers to read/write to the rrd files with the rrd directory also exported by NFS for simple access and maintenance. Memcache Memcache is required for the distributed pollers to be able to register to a central location and record what devices are polled. Memcache can run from any of the servers so long as it is accessible by all pollers. Pollers Pollers can be installed and run from anywhere, the only requirements are: They can access the Memcache instance They can create RRD files via some method such as a shared filesystem or RRDTool >=1.5.5 They can access the MySQL server You can either assign pollers into groups and set a poller group against certain devices, this will mean that those devices will only be processed by certain pollers (default poller group is 0) or you can assign all pollers to the default poller group for them to process any and all devices. This will provide the ability to have a single poller behind a NAT firewall monitor internal devices and report back to your central system. You will then be able to monitor those devices from the Web UI as normal. Another benefit to this is that you can provide N+x pollers, i.e if you know that you require three pollers to process all devices within 300 seconds then adding a 4th poller will mean that should any one single poller fail then the remaining three will complete polling in time. You could also use this to take a poller out of service for maintenance, i.e OS updates and software updates. It is extremely advisable to either run a central recursive dns server such as pdns-recursor and have all of your pollers use this or install a recursive dns server on each poller - the volume of DNS requests on large installs can be significant and will slow polling down enough to cause issues with a large number of devices. A last note to make sure of, is that all pollers writing to the same DB need to have the same APP_KEY value set in the .env file. Discovery It's not necessary to run discovery services on all pollers. In fact, you should only run one discovery process per poller group. Designate a single poller to run discovery (or a separate server if required). Configuration Settings in config.php should be copied to all servers as they only apply locally. One way around this is to set settings in the database via the web ui or ./lnms config:set Config sample The following config is taken from a live setup which consists of a Web server, DB server, RRDCached server and 3 pollers.

Then you can procede to the LibreNMS Web UI and go to Oxidized Settings in the External Settings section of Global Settings. Enable it and enter the url to your oxidized instance. To have devices automatically added, you will need to configure oxidized to pull them from LibreNMS Feeding Oxidized LibreNMS will automatically map the OS to the Oxidized model name if they don't match. this means you shouldn't need to use the model_map config option within Oxidized. Detailed integration information This is a straight forward use of Oxidized, it relies on you having a working Oxidized setup which is already taking config snapshots for your devices. When you have that, you only need the following config to enable the display of device configs within the device page itself: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'enabled' ] = TRUE ; $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'url' ] = 'http://127.0.0.1:8888' ; LibreNMS supports config versioning if Oxidized does. This is known to work with the git output module. $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'features' ][ 'versioning' ] = true ; Oxidized supports various ways to utilise credentials to login to devices, you can specify global username/password within Oxidized, Group level username/password or per device. LibreNMS currently supports sending groups back to Oxidized so that you can then define group credentials within Oxidized. To enable this support please switch on 'Enable the return of groups to Oxidized': $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'group_support' ] = true ; You can set a default group that devices will fall back to with: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'default_group' ] = 'default' ; SELinux If you're runnng SELinux, you'll need to allow httpd to connect outbound to the network, otherwise Oxidized integration in the web UI will silently fail: setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1 Feeding Oxidized Oxidized has support for feeding devices into it via an API call, support for Oxidized has been added to the LibreNMS API. A sample config for Oxidized is provided below. You will need to configure default credentials for your devices in the Oxidized config, LibreNMS doesn't provide login credentials at this time. source: default: http debug: false http: url: https://librenms/api/v0/oxidized map: name: hostname model: os group: group headers: X-Auth-Token: '01582bf94c03104ecb7953dsadsadwed' LibreNMS is able to reload the Oxidized list of nodes, each time a device is added to LibreNMS. To do so, edit the option in Global Settings>External Settings>Oxidized Integration or add the following to your config.php. $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'reload_nodes' ] = true ; Creating overrides To return an override to Oxidized you can do this by providing the override key, followed by matching a lookup for a host (or hosts), and finally by defining the overriding value itself. LibreNMS does not check for the validity of these attributes but will deliver them to Oxidized as defined. Matching of hosts can be done using hostname , sysname , os , location , sysDescr or hardware and including either a 'match' key and value, or a 'regex' key and value. The order of matching is: hostname sysname sysDescr hardware os location ip To match on the device hostnames or sysnames that contain 'lon-sw' or if the location contains 'London' then you would place the following within config.php: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'hostname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^lon-sw/' , 'group' => 'london-switches' ); $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^lon-sw/' , 'group' => 'london-switches' ); $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'location' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/london/' , 'group' => 'london-switches' ); To match on a device os of edgeos then please use the following: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'os' ][] = array ( 'match' => 'edgeos' , 'group' => 'wireless' ); Matching on OS requires system name of the OS. For example, 'match' => 'RouterOS' will not work, while 'match' => 'routeros' will. To override the IP Oxidized uses to poll the device, you can add the following within config.php: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'ip' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^my.node/' , 'ip' => '192.168.1.10' ); $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'ip' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'match' => 'my-other.node' , 'ip' => '192.168.1.20' ); This allows extending the configuration further by providing a completely flexible model for custom flags and settings, for example, below shows the ability to add an ssh_proxy host within Oxidized simply by adding the below to your configuration: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'ssh_proxy' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^my.node/' , 'ssh_proxy' => 'my-ssh-gateway.node' ); Or of course, any custom value that could be needed or wanted can be applied, for example, setting a \"myAttribute\" to \"Super cool value\" for any configured and enabled \"routeros\" device. $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'myAttribute' ][ 'os' ][] = array ( 'match' => 'routeros' , 'myAttribute' => 'Super cool value' ); Verify the return of groups by querying the API: curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0/oxidized If you need to, you can specify credentials for groups by using the following in your Oxidized config: groups: <groupname>: username: <user> password: <password> Miscellaneous If you have devices which you do not wish to appear in Oxidized then you can edit those devices in Device -> Edit -> Misc and enable \"Exclude from Oxidized?\" It's also possible to exclude certain device types and OS' from being output via the API. This is currently only possible via config.php: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'ignore_types' ] = array ( 'server' , 'power' ); $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'ignore_os' ] = array ( 'linux' , 'windows' ); Trigger configuration backups Using the Oxidized REST API and Syslog Hooks , Oxidized can trigger configuration downloads whenever a configuration change event has been logged. An example script to do this is included in ./scripts/syslog-notify-oxidized.php . Oxidized can spawn a new worker thread and perform the download immediately with the following configuration next_adds_job: true Validate Oxidized config You can perform basic validation of the Oxidized configuration by going to the Overview -> Tools -> Oxidized link and in the Oxidized config validation page, paste your yaml file into the input box and click 'Validate YAML'.

LibreNMS does not check for the validity of these attributes but will deliver them to Oxidized as defined. Matching of hosts can be done using hostname , sysname , os , location , sysDescr or hardware and including either a 'match' key and value, or a 'regex' key and value. The order of matching is: hostname sysname sysDescr hardware os location ip To match on the device hostnames or sysnames that contain 'lon-sw' or if the location contains 'London' then you would place the following within config.php: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'hostname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^lon-sw/' , 'group' => 'london-switches' ); $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^lon-sw/' , 'group' => 'london-switches' ); $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'location' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/london/' , 'group' => 'london-switches' ); To match on a device os of edgeos then please use the following: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'group' ][ 'os' ][] = array ( 'match' => 'edgeos' , 'group' => 'wireless' ); Matching on OS requires system name of the OS. For example, 'match' => 'RouterOS' will not work, while 'match' => 'routeros' will. To override the IP Oxidized uses to poll the device, you can add the following within config.php: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'ip' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^my.node/' , 'ip' => '192.168.1.10' ); $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'ip' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'match' => 'my-other.node' , 'ip' => '192.168.1.20' ); This allows extending the configuration further by providing a completely flexible model for custom flags and settings, for example, below shows the ability to add an ssh_proxy host within Oxidized simply by adding the below to your configuration: $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'ssh_proxy' ][ 'sysname' ][] = array ( 'regex' => '/^my.node/' , 'ssh_proxy' => 'my-ssh-gateway.node' ); Or of course, any custom value that could be needed or wanted can be applied, for example, setting a \"myAttribute\" to \"Super cool value\" for any configured and enabled \"routeros\" device. $config [ 'oxidized' ][ 'maps' ][ 'myAttribute' ][ 'os' ][] = array ( 'match' => 'routeros' , 'myAttribute' => 'Super cool value' ); Verify the return of groups by querying the API: curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0/oxidized If you need to, you can specify credentials for groups by using the following in your Oxidized config: groups: <groupname>: username: <user> password: <password>","title":"Creating overrides"},{"location":"Extensions/Oxidized/#miscellaneous","text":"If you have devices which you do not wish to appear in Oxidized then you can edit those devices in Device -> Edit -> Misc and enable \"Exclude from Oxidized?\" It's also possible to exclude certain device types and OS' from being output via the API.

Usually, changing the configuration on a network device, or plugging/unplugging a network cable (LinkUp, LinkDown) will generate a trap. You can confirm it using a with tcpdump , tshark or wireshark . You can also generate a trap using the snmptrap command from the LibreNMS server itself (if and only if the LibreNMS server is monitored). How to send SNMP v2 Trap The command below takes the form of: snmptrap -v <snmp_version> -c <community> <destination_host> <uptime> <OID_or_MIB> <object> <value_type> <value> Using OID's: snmptrap -v 2c -c public localhost '' 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.3.0.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.3.2.1 i 123456 If you have configured logging of traps to /var/log/snmptrap/traps.log then you will see in traps.log new entry: 2020-03-09 16:22:59 localhost [UDP: [127.0.0.1]:58942->[127.0.0.1]:162]: SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (149721964) 17 days, 7:53:39.64 SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.8072.2.3.0.1 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.8072.2.3.2.1 = INTEGER: 123456 and in LibreNMS your localhost device eventlog like: 2020-03-09 16:22:59 SNMP trap received: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.8072.2.3.0.1 Why we need Uptime When you send a trap, it must of course conform to a set of standards. Every trap needs an uptime value. Uptime is how long the system has been running since boot. Sometimes this is the operating system, other devices might use the SNMP engine uptime. Regardless, a value will be sent. So what value should you type in the commands below? Oddly enough, simply supplying no value by using two single quotes '' will instruct the command to obtain the value from the operating system you are executing this on. Event logging You can configure generic event logging for snmp traps. This will log an event of the type trap for received traps. These events can be used for alerting. By default, only the TrapOID is logged. Buf you can enable the \"detailed\" variant, and all the data received with the trap will be logged. The parameter can be found in General Settings / External / SNMP Traps Integration. It can also be configured in config.php $config [ 'snmptraps' ][ 'eventlog' ] = 'unhandled' ; //default value $config [ 'snmptraps' ][ 'eventlog_detailed' ] = 'false' ; //default value Valid options are: unhandled only unhandled traps will be logged (default value) all log all traps none no traps will create a generic event log (handled traps may still log events)","title":"SNMP Trap Handler"},{"location":"Extensions/SNMP-Trap-Handler/#snmp-trap-handling","text":"Currently, LibreNMS supports a lot of trap handlers.

Services can also be used in conjuction with your SNMP monitoring for larger monitoring functionality. Services must be tied to a device to function properly. A good generic option is to use localhost , but it is suggest to attach the check to the device you are monitoring. Nagios plugins source Plugins come from two main sources: monitoring-plugins pkg-nagios-plugins-contrib Note: Plugins will only load if they are prefixed with check_ . The check_ prefix is stripped out when displaying in the \"Add Service\" GUI \"Type\" dropdown list. Setup Service checks are now distributable if you run a distributed setup. To leverage this, use the dispatch service. Alternatively, you could also replace check-services.php with services-wrapper.py in cron instead to run across all polling nodes. If you need to debug the output of services-wrapper.py then you can add -d to the end of the command - it is NOT recommended to do this in cron. Firstly, install Nagios plugins. Debian / Ubuntu: sudo apt install monitoring-plugins Centos: yum install nagios-plugins-all Note: The plugins are bundled with the pre-build VM and Docker images. Next, you need to enable the services within config.php with the following: $config [ 'show_services' ] = 1 ; This will enable a new service menu within your navbar. Debian/Ubuntu: $config [ 'nagios_plugins' ] = \"/usr/lib/nagios/plugins\" ; Centos: $config [ 'nagios_plugins' ] = \"/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins\" ; This will point LibreNMS at the location of the nagios plugins - please ensure that any plugins you use are set to executable. For example: Debian/Ubuntu: chmod +x /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/* Centos: chmod +x /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/* Finally, you now need to add services-wrapper.py to the current cron file (/etc/cron.d/librenms typically) like: */5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/services-wrapper.py 1 Now you can add services via the main Services link in the navbar, or via the 'Add Service' link within the device, services page. Note that some services (procs, inodes, load and similar) will always poll the local LibreNMS server it's running on, regardless of which device you add it to. Performance data By default, the check-services script will collect all performance data that the Nagios script returns and display each datasource on a separate graph. LibreNMS expects scripts to return using Nagios convention for the response message structure: AEN200 However for some modules it would be better if some of this information was consolidated on a single graph. An example is the ICMP check. This check returns: Round Trip Average (rta), Round Trip Min (rtmin) and Round Trip Max (rtmax). These have been combined onto a single graph. If you find a check script that would benefit from having some datasources graphed together, please log an issue on GitHub with the debug information from the script, and let us know which DS's should go together. Example below: ./check-services.php -d -- snip -- Nagios Service - 26 Request: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_icmp localhost Perf Data - DS: rta, Value: 0.016, UOM: ms Perf Data - DS: pl, Value: 0, UOM: % Perf Data - DS: rtmax, Value: 0.044, UOM: ms Perf Data - DS: rtmin, Value: 0.009, UOM: ms Response: OK - localhost: rta 0.016ms, lost 0% Service DS: { \"rta\": \"ms\", \"pl\": \"%\", \"rtmax\": \"ms\", \"rtmin\": \"ms\" } OK u:0.00 s:0.00 r:40.67 RRD[update /opt/librenms/rrd/localhost/services-26.rrd N:0.016:0:0.044:0.009] -- snip -- Alerting Services uses the Nagios Alerting scheme where exit code: 0 = Ok, 1 = Warning, 2 = Critical, To create an alerting rule to alert on service=critical, your alerting rule would look like: %services.service_status = \"2\" Debug Change user to librenms for example su - librenms then you can run the following command to help troubleshoot services. ./check-services.php -d Service checks polling logic Service check is skipped when the associated device is not pingable, and an appropriate entry is populated in the event log.

To fix this issue, you can configure LibreNMS to translate the incoming syslog hostname into another hostname, so that the logs get associated with the correct device. Example: $config['syslog_xlate'] = array( 'loopback0.core7k1.noc.net' => 'n7k1-core7k1', 'loopback0.core7k2.noc.net' => 'n7k2-core7k2' );","title":"Syslog"},{"location":"Extensions/Syslog/#setting-up-syslog-support","text":"This document will explain how to send syslog data to LibreNMS.

Installing Network-WeatherMap Step 1 Extract to your LibreNMS plugins directory /opt/librenms/html/plugins so you should see something like /opt/librenms/html/plugins/Weathermap/ The best way to do this is via git. Go to your install directory and then /opt/librenms/html/plugins Enter: git clone https://github.com/librenms-plugins/Weathermap.git Step 2 Inside the html/plugins directory, change the ownership of the Weathermap directory by typing chown -R librenms:librenms Weathermap/ Make the configs directory writeable chmod 775 /opt/librenms/html/plugins/Weathermap/configs Note if you are using SELinux you need to input the following command chcon -R -t httpd_cache_t Weathermap/ Step 3 Enable the cron process by editing your current LibreNMS cron file (typically /etc/cron.d/librenms) and add the following: */5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/html/plugins/Weathermap/map-poller.php >> /dev/null 2>&1 Step 4 Enable the plugin from LibreNMS Web UI in OverView ->Plugins -> Plugin Admin menu. Step 5 Now you should see Weathermap Overview -> Plugins -> Weathermap Create your maps, please note when you create a MAP, please click Map Style, ensure Overlib is selected for HTML Style and click submit. Also, ensure you set an output image filename and output HTML filename in Map Properties. I'd recommend you use the output folder as this is excluded from git updates (i.e enter output/mymap.png and output/mymap.html). Optional: If your install is in another directory than standard, set $basehref within map-poller.php . WeatherMapper Automatically generate weathermaps from a LibreNMS database using WeatherMapper Link Adding your Network Weathermaps to the Dashboards Once you have created your Network Weather Map you can add it to a dashboard page by doing the following.

Let's start off by saying, all of the code that processes the data and submits it is included in the standard LibreNMS branch you've installed, the code that accepts this data and in turn generates some pretty graphs is all open source and available on Git Hub. Please feel free to review the code, comment on it and suggest changes / improvements. Also, don't forget - by default installations DO NOT call back home, you need to opt into this. Above all we respect users privacy which is why this system has been designed like it has. Now onto the bit you're interested in, what is submitted and what we do with that data. What is submitted All data is anonymous. Generic statistics are taken from the database, these include things like device count, device type, device OS, port types, port speeds, port count and BGP peer count. Take a look at the code for full details. Pairs of sysDescr and sysObjectID from devices with a small amount of sanitation to prevent things like hostnames from being submitted. We record version numbers of php, mysql, net-snmp and rrdtool A random UUID is generated on your own install. That's it! Your IP isn't logged, even via our web service accepting the data. We don't need to know who you are so we don't ask. What we do with the data We store it, not for long - 3 months at the moment although this could change. We use it to generate pretty graphs for people to see. We use it to help prioritise issues and features that need to be worked on. We use sysDescr and sysObjectID to create unit tests and improve OS discovery Questions? Q. How often is data submitted? A. We submit the data once a day according to running daily.sh via cron. If you disable this then opting in will not have any affect. Q. Where can I see the data I submitted? A. You can't see the data raw, but we collate all of the data together and provide a dynamic site so you can see the results of all contributed stats here Q. I want my data removed. A. That's easy, simply press 'Clear remote stats' in the About LibreNMS page of your control panel, the next time the call back script is run it will remove all the data we have. Q. I clicked the 'Clear remote stats' button by accident. A. No problem, before daily.sh runs again - just opt back in, all of your existing data will stay. Hopefully this answers the questions you might have on why and what we are doing here, if not, please pop into our discord server or community forum and ask any questions you like. How do I enable stats submission? If you're happy with all of this - please consider switching the call back system on, you can do this within the About LibreNMS page within your control panel. In the Statistics section you will find a toggle switch to enable / disable the feature. If you've previously had it switched on and want to opt out and remove your data, click the 'Clear remote stats' button and on the next submission all the data you've sent us will be removed!","title":"Submitting stats"},{"location":"General/Callback-Stats-and-Privacy/#stats-data-and-your-privacy","text":"This document has been put together to explain what LibreNMS does when it calls back home to report some anonymous statistics.

The reason for the fork has nothing to do with Observium's move to community vs. paid versions . It is simply that we have different priorities and values to the Observium development team. We decided to fork (reluctantly) because we like using Observium, but we want to collaborate on a community-based project with like-minded IT professionals. See README.md and the references there for more information about the kind of community we're trying to promote. LibreNMS was forked from the last GPL-licensed version of Observium . Thanks to one of our users, Dan Brown, who has written a migration script , you can easily move your Observium install over to LibreNMS. This also takes care of moving from one CPU architecture to another. Give it a try :) How LibreNMS will be different from Observium: We will have an inclusive community, where it's OK to ask stupid questions, and OK to ask for things that aren't on the roadmap. If you'd like to see something added, add or comment on the relevant issue in our Community forum . Development decisions will be community-driven. We want to make software that fulfills its users' needs. There are no plans for a paid version, and we don't anticipate this ever changing. There are no current plans for paid support, but this may be added later if there is sufficient demand. We use git for version control and GitHub for hosting to make it as easy and painless as possible to create forked or private versions. Reasons why you might want to use Observium instead of LibreNMS: You have a financial investment in Observium and aren't concerned about community contributions. You don't like the GNU General Public License, version 3 or the philosophy of Free Software/copyleft in general. Reasons why you might want to use LibreNMS instead of Observium: You want to work with others on the project, knowing that your investment of time and effort will not be wasted . You want to add and experiment with features that are not a priority for the Observium developers. See CONTRIBUTING for more details. You want to make use of the additional features LibreNMS can offer.","title":"Welcome to Observium users"},{"location":"Installation/","text":"Installing LibreNMS Docker An official LibreNMS docker image based on Alpine Linux and Nginx is available on DockerHub .

Please do not expose it to the public Internet unless you have configured HTTPS and taken appropriate web server hardening steps. Add the first device We now suggest that you add localhost as your first device from within the WebUI. Troubleshooting If you ever have issues with your install, run validate.php: sudo su - librenms ./validate.php There are various options for getting help listed on the LibreNMS web site: https://www.librenms.org/#support What next? Now that you've installed LibreNMS, we'd suggest that you have a read of a few other docs to get you going: Performance tuning Alerting Device Groups Auto discovery Closing We hope you enjoy using LibreNMS. If you do, it would be great if you would consider opting into the stats system we have, please see this page on what it is and how to enable it.

If you would like to clone via SSH instead, use the command git clone git@github.com:librenms/librenms.git librenms instead. Prepare the Web Interface To prepare the web interface, you'll need to create and chown a directory as well as create an Apache vhost. First, create and chown the rrd directory and create the logs directory mkdir rrd logs chown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms chmod 775 rrd If you're planing on running rrdcached, make sure that the path is also chmod'ed to 775 and chown'ed to librenms:librenms.

Alternatively if you want to continue the setup manually then perform the manual install steps. If you cannot reach the installer, stop here and solve that problem before proceeding. Afterwards, Add the following line to the end of config.php : $config['fping'] = \"/usr/sbin/fping\"; Manual Install You may skip this section if the web installer succeeded. cp config.php.default config.php vi config.php Change the values to the right of the equal sign for lines beginning with $config[db_] to match your database information as previously configured. Change the value of $config['snmp']['community'] from public to whatever your default read-only SNMP community is. If you have multiple existing communities in your environment, set it to the most common. Add the following line to the end of config.php : $config['fping'] = \"/usr/sbin/fping\"; Important: Be sure you have no characters (including whitespace like: newlines, spaces, tabs, etc) outside of the <?php?> blocks. Your graphs will break otherwise and there will be no error messages to indicate otherwise! Initialize the database Initiate the follow database with the following command: php build-base.php Create admin user Create the admin user - priv should be 10 php adduser.php <name> <pass> 10 <email> Substitute your desired username, password and email address--and leave the angled brackets off. Validate your install After performing the manual install or web install, be sure to run validate.php as root in the librenms directory: php validate.php This will check your install to verify it is set up correctly. Add localhost php addhost.php localhost public v2c Replace public to match what you set in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf . This command also assumes you are using SNMP v2c. If you're using v3, there are additional steps (NOTE: instructions for SNMPv3 to come). Discover localhost: php discovery.php -h all Create cronjob The polling method used by LibreNMS is poller-wrapper.py , which was placed in the public domain by its author. By default, the LibreNMS cronjob runs poller-wrapper.py with 16 threads. The current LibreNMS recommendation is to use 4 threads per core. The default if no thread count is 16 threads . If the thread count needs to be changed, you can do so by editing the cron file ( /etc/cron.d/librenms ). Just add a number after poller-wrapper.py , as in the below example: /opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 12 >> /dev/null 2>&1 Create the cronjob cp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms NOTE: Keep in mind that cron, by default, only uses a very limited set of environment variables. You may need to configure proxy variables for the cron invocation. Alternatively adding the proxy settings in config.php is possible too. The config.php file will be created in the upcoming steps.

NOTE: Setting a higher timeout value than the interval value can lead to slowing down poller. Example: timeout: 3000 count: 3 interval: 500 In this example, interval will be overwritten by the timeout value of 3000 which is 3 seconds.

This allows you to keep the SysLocation string short and keeps Rack/Room/Building information intact after the substitution. The above are examples, these will rewrite device snmp locations so you don't need to configure full location within snmp. Interfaces to be ignored Interfaces can be automatically ignored during discovery by modifying bad_if* entries in a default array, unsetting a default array and customizing it, or creating an OS specific array. The preferred method for ignoring interfaces is to use an OS specific array. The default arrays can be found in misc/config_definitions.json. OS specific definitions (includes/definitions/ specific_os .yaml) can contain bad_if* arrays, but should only be modified via pull-request as manipulation of the definition files will block updating. Examples: Add entries to default arrays $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voip-null\" ; $config [ 'bad_iftype' ][] = \"voiceEncap\" ; $config [ 'bad_if_regexp' ][] = '/^lo[0-9].*/' ; // loopback Unset and customize a default array unset ( $config [ 'bad_if' ]); $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voip-null\" ; $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voiceEncap\" ; $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voiceFXO\" ; ...

Interfaces that shouldn't be ignored Examples: $config [ 'good_if' ][] = 'FastEthernet' ; $config [ 'os' ][ 'ios' ][ 'good_if' ][] = 'FastEthernet' ; good_if is matched against ifDescr value. This can be a bad_if value as well which would stop that port from being ignored. I.e If bad_if and good_if both contained FastEthernet then ports with this value in the ifDescr will be valid. Interfaces to be rewritten $config [ 'rewrite_if' ][ 'cpu' ] = 'Management Interface' ; $config [ 'rewrite_if_regexp' ][ '/cpu /' ] = 'Management ' ; Entries defined in rewrite_if are being replaced completely. Entries defined in rewrite_if_regexp only replace the match. Matches are compared case-insensitive. Entity sensors to be ignored Some devices register bogus sensors as they are returned via SNMP but either don't exist or just don't return data. This allows you to ignore those based on the descr field in the database. You can either ignore globally or on a per os basis. $config [ 'bad_entity_sensor_regex' ][] = '/Physical id [0-9]+/' ; $config [ 'os' ][ 'cisco' ][ 'bad_entity_sensor_regex' ] = '/Physical id [0-9]+/' ; Entity sensors limit values Vendors may give some limit values (or thresholds) for the discovered sensors.

What information do you need to add a new OS? What can I do to help? How can I test another users branch? How do I install LibreNMS? This is currently well documented within the doc folder of the installation files. Please see the following doc How do I add a device? You have two options for adding a new device into LibreNMS. 1: Using the command line via ssh you can add a new device by changing to the directory of your LibreNMS install and typing (be sure to put the correct details). ./addhost.php [community] [v1|v2c] [port] [udp|udp6|tcp|tcp6] Please note that if the community contains special characters such as $ then you will need to wrap it in ' . I.e: 'Pa$$w0rd' . 2: Using the web interface, go to Devices and then Add Device. Enter the details required for the device that you want to add and then click 'Add Host'. How do I get help? Getting Help What are the supported OSes for installing LibreNMS on? Supported is quite a strong word :) The 'officially' supported distros are: Ubuntu / Debian Red Hat / CentOS Gentoo However we will always aim to help wherever possible so if you are running a distro that isn't one of the above then give it a try anyway and if you need help then jump on the discord server . Do you have a demo available? We do indeed, you can find access to the demo here How does LibreNMS use MIBs? LibreNMS does not parse MIBs to discover sensors for devices. LibreNMS uses static discovery definitions written in YAML or PHP. Therefore, updating a MIB alone will not improve OS support, the definitions must be updated. LibreNMS only uses MIBs to make OIDs easier to read. Why do I get blank pages sometimes in the WebUI? You can enable debug information by setting APP_DEBUG=true in your .env. (Do not leave this enabled, it could leak private data) If the page you are trying to load has a substantial amount of data in it then it could be that the php memory limit needs to be increased in config.php . Why do I not see any graphs? The easiest way to check if all is well is to run ./validate.php as root from within your install directory. This should give you info on why things aren't working. One other reason could be a restricted snmpd.conf file or snmp view which limits the data sent back. If you use net-snmp then we suggest using the included snmpd.conf file. How do I debug pages not loading correctly? A debug system is in place which enables you to see the output from php errors, warnings and notices along with the MySQL queries that have been run for that page. You can enable debug information by setting APP_DEBUG=true in your .env. (Do not leave this enabled, it could leak private data) To see additional information, run ./scripts/composer_wrapper.php install , to install additional debug tools. This will add a debug bar at the bottom of every page that will show you detailed debug information. How do I debug the discovery process? Please see the Discovery Support document for further details. How do I debug the poller process? Please see the Poller Support document for further details. Why do I get a lot apache or rrdtool zombies in my process list? If this is related to your web service for LibreNMS then this has been tracked down to an issue within php which the developers aren't fixing. We have implemented a work around which means you shouldn't be seeing this. If you are, please report this in issue 443 . Why do I see traffic spikes in my graphs? This occurs either when a counter resets or the device sends back bogus data making it look like a counter reset. We have enabled support for setting a maximum value for rrd files for ports. Before this all rrd files were set to 100G max values, now you can enable support to limit this to the actual port speed. rrdtool tune will change the max value when the interface speed is detected as being changed (min value will be set for anything 10M or over) or when you run the included script (./scripts/tune_port.php) - see RRDTune doc SNMP ifInOctets and ifOutOctets are counters, which means they start at 0 (at device boot) and count up from there. LibreNMS records the value every 5 minutes and uses the difference between the previous value and the current value to calculate rate. (Also, this value resets to 0 when it hits the max value) Now, when the value is not recorded for awhile RRD (our time series storage) does not record a 0, it records the last value, otherwise, there would be even worse problems. Then finally we get the current ifIn/OutOctets value and record that. Now, it appears as though all of the traffic since it stopped getting values have occurred in the last 5 minute interval. So whenever you see spikes like this, it means we have not received data from the device for several polling intervals. The cause can vary quite a bit: bad snmp implementations, intermittant network connectivity, broken poller, and more. Why do I see gaps in my graphs? This is most commonly due to the poller not being able to complete it's run within 300 seconds. Check which devices are causing this by going to /poll-log/ within the Web interface. When you find the device(s) which are taking the longest you can then look at the Polling module graph under Graphs -> Poller -> Poller Modules Performance. Take a look at what modules are taking the longest and disabled un used modules. If you poll a large number of devices / ports then it's recommended to run a local recurisve dns server such as pdns-recursor. Running RRDCached is also highly advised in larger installs but has benefits no matter the size. How do I change the IP / hostname of a device? There is a host rename tool called renamehost.php in your librenms root directory. When renaming you are also changing the device's IP / hostname address for monitoring. Usage: ./renamehost.php <old hostname> <new hostname> You can also rename a device in the Web UI by going to the device, then clicking settings Icon -> Edit. My device doesn't finish polling within 300 seconds We have a few things you can try: Disable unnecessary polling modules under edit device. Set a max repeater value within the snmp settings for a device. What to set this to is tricky, you really should run an snmpbulkwalk with -Cr10 through -Cr50 to see what works best. 50 is usually a good choice if the device can cope. Things aren't working correctly? Run ./validate.php as root from within your install. Re-run ./validate.php once you've resolved any issues raised. You have an odd issue - we'd suggest you join our discord server to discuss. What do the values mean in my graphs? The values you see are reported as metric values. Thanks to a post on Reddit here are those values: 10^-18 a - atto 10^-15 f - femto 10^-12 p - pico 10^-9 n - nano 10^-6 u - micro 10^-3 m - milli 0 (no unit) 10^3 k - kilo 10^6 M - mega 10^9 G - giga 10^12 T - tera 10^15 P - peta Why does a device show as a warning? This is indicating that the device has rebooted within the last 24 hours (by default). If you want to adjust this threshold then you can do so by setting $config['uptime_warning'] = '84600'; in config.php . The value must be in seconds. Why do I not see all interfaces in the Overall traffic graph for a device? By default numerous interface types and interface descriptions are excluded from this graph. The excluded defailts are: $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/loopback/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/tunnel/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/virtual/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/mpls/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ieee8023adLag/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/l2vlan/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ppp/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/loopback/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/vlan/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/tunnel/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/bond/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/null/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/dummy/' ; If you would like to re-include l2vlan interfaces for instance, you first need to unset the config array and set your options: unset ( $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ]); $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/loopback/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/tunnel/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/virtual/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/mpls/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ieee8023adLag/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ppp/' ; How do I move my LibreNMS install to another server? If you are moving from one CPU architecture to another then you will need to dump the rrd files and re-create them. If you are in this scenario then you can use Dan Brown's migration scripts . If you are just moving to another server with the same CPU architecture then the following steps should be all that's needed: Install LibreNMS as per our normal documentation; you don't need to run through the web installer or building the sql schema. Stop cron by commenting out all lines in /etc/cron.d/librenms Dump the MySQL database librenms from your old server ( mysqldump librenms -u root -p > librenms.sql )... and import it into your new server ( mysql -u root -p librenms < librenms.sql ). Copy the rrd/ folder to the new server. Copy the .env and config.php files to the new server. Check for modified files (eg specific os, ...) with git status and migrate them. Ensure ownership of the copied files and folders (substitute your user if necessary) - chown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms Delete old pollers on the GUI (gear icon --> Pollers --> Pollers) Validate your installation (/opt/librenms/validate.php) Re-enable cron by uncommenting all lines in /etc/cron.d/librenms Why is my EdgeRouter device not detected? If you have service snmp description set in your config then this will be why, please remove this. For some reason Ubnt have decided setting this value should override the sysDescr value returned which breaks our detection. If you don't have that set then this may be then due to an update of EdgeOS or a new device type, please create an issue . Why are some of my disks not showing? If you are monitoring a linux server then net-snmp doesn't always expose all disks via hrStorage (HOST-RESOURCES-MIB). We have additional support which will retrieve disks via dskTable (UCD-SNMP-MIB). To expose these disks you need to add additional config to your snmpd.conf file. For example, to expose /dev/sda1 which may be mounted as /storage you can specify: disk /dev/sda1 Or disk /storage Restart snmpd and LibreNMS should populate the additional disk after a fresh discovery. Why are my disks reporting an incorrect size? There is a known issue for net-snmp, which causes it to report incorrect disk size and disk usage when the size of the disk (or raid) are larger then 16TB, a workaround has been implemented but is not active on Centos 6.8 by default due to the fact that this workaround breaks official SNMP specs, and as such could cause unexpected behaviour in other SNMP tools. You can activate the workaround by adding to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf : realStorageUnits 0 What does mean \\\"ignore alert tag\\\" on device, component, service and port? Tag device, component, service and port to ignore alerts. Alert checks will still run. However, ignore tag can be read in alert rules. For example on device, if devices.ignore = 0 or macros.device = 1 condition is is set and ignore alert tag is on, the alert rule won't match. The alert rule is ignored. How do I add support for a new OS? Please see Supporting a new OS if you are adding all the support yourself, i.e. writing all of the supporting code. If you are only able to supply supporting info, and would like the help of others to write up the code, please follow the below steps. What information do you need to add a new OS? Please open a feature request in the community forum and provide the output of Discovery, Poller, and Snmpwalk as separate non-expiring https://p.libren.ms/ links : Please use preferably the command line to obtain the information. Especially, if snmpwalk results in a large amount of data. Replace the relevant information in these commands such as HOSTNAME and COMMUNITY. Use snmpwalk instead of snmpbulkwalk for v1 devices. These commands will automatically upload the data to LibreNMS servers. ./discovery.php -h HOSTNAME -d | ./pbin.sh ./poller.php -h HOSTNAME -r -f -d | ./pbin.sh snmpbulkwalk -OUneb -v2c -c COMMUNITY HOSTNAME . | ./pbin.sh You can use the links provided by these commands within the community post. If possible please also provide what the OS name should be if it doesn't exist already, as well as any useful link (MIBs from vendor, logo, etc etc) What can I do to help? Thanks for asking, sometimes it's not quite so obvious and everyone can contribute something different. So here are some ways you can help LibreNMS improve. Code. This is a big thing. We want this community to grow by the software developing and evolving to cater for users needs. The biggest area that people can help make this happen is by providing code support. This doesn't necessarily mean contributing code for discovering a new device: Web UI, a new look and feel has been adopted but we are not finished by any stretch of the imagination. Make suggestions, find and fix bugs, update the design / layout. Poller / Discovery code. Improving it (we think a lot can be done to speed things up), adding new device support and updating old ones. The LibreNMS main website, this is hosted on GitHub like the main repo and we accept use contributions here as well :) Hardware. We don't physically need it but if we are to add device support, it's made a whole lot easier with access to the kit via SNMP. If you've got MIBs, they are handy as well :) If you know the vendor and can get permission to use logos that's also great. Bugs. Found one? We want to know about it. Most bugs are fixed after being spotted and reported by someone, I'd love to say we are amazing developers and will fix all bugs before you spot them but that's just not true. Feature requests. Can't code / won't code. No worries, chuck a feature request into our community forum with enough detail and someone will take a look. A lot of the time this might be what interests someone, they need the same feature or they just have time. Please be patient, everyone who contributes does so in their own time. Documentation. Documentation can always be improved and every little bit helps. Not all features are currently documented or documented well, there's speeling mistakes etc. It's very easy to submit updates through the GitHub website , no git experience needed. Be nice, this is the foundation of this project. We expect everyone to be nice. People will fall out, people will disagree but please do it so in a respectable way. Ask questions. Sometimes just by asking questions you prompt deeper conversations that can lead us to somewhere amazing so please never be afraid to ask a question. How can I test another users branch? LibreNMS can and is developed by anyone, this means someone may be working on a new feature or support for a device that you want. It can be helpful for others to test these new features, using Git, this is made easy. cd /opt/librenms Firstly ensure that your current branch is in good state: git status If you see nothing to commit, working directory clean then let's go for it :) Let's say that you want to test a users (f0o) new development branch (issue-1337) then you can do the following: git remote add f0o https://github.com/f0o/librenms.git git remote update f0o git checkout issue-1337 Once you are done testing, you can easily switch back to the master branch: git checkout master If you want to pull any new updates provided by f0o's branch then whilst you are still in it, do the following: git pull f0o issue-1337 Why can't Normal and Global View users see Oxidized? Configs can often contain sensitive data. Because of that only global admins can see configs. What is the Demo User for? Demo users allow full access except adding/editing users and deleting devices and can't change passwords. Why does modifying 'Default Alert Template' fail? This template's entry could be missing in the database. Please run this from the LibreNMS directory: php artisan db:seed --class = DefaultAlertTemplateSeeder Why would alert un-mute itself? If alert un-mutes itself then it most likely means that the alert cleared and is then triggered again. Please review eventlog as it will tell you in there. How do I change the Device Type? You can change the Device Type by going to the device you would like to change, then click on the Gear Icon -> Edit. If you would like to define custom types, we suggest using Device Groups . They will be listed in the menu similarly to device types. Where do I update my database credentials? If you've changed your database credentials then you will need to update LibreNMS with those new details. Please edit .env .env : DB_HOST= DB_DATABASE= DB_USERNAME= DB_PASSWORD= DB_PORT= My reverse proxy is not working Make sure your proxy is passing the proper variables. At a minimum: X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto (X-Forwarded-Port if needed) You also need to Set the proxy or proxies as trusted If you are using a subdirectory on the reverse proxy and not on the actual web server, you may need to set APP_URL and $config['base_url'] . My alerts aren't being delivered on time If you're running MySQL/MariaDB on a separate machine or container make sure the timezone is set properly on both the LibreNMS and MySQL/MariaDB instance. Alerts will be delivered according to MySQL/MariaDB's time, so a mismatch between the two can cause alerts to be delivered late if LibreNMS is on a timezone later than MySQL/MariaDB. My alert templates stopped working You should probably have a look in the documentation concerning the new template syntax: https://docs.librenms.org/Alerting/Templates/ . Since version 1.42, syntax changed, and you basically need to convert your templates to this new syntax (including the titles). How do I use trend prediction in graphs As of Ver. 1.55 a new feature has been added where you can view a simple linear prediction in port graphs. It doesn't work on non-port graphs or consolidated graphs at the time this FAQ entry was written. To view a prediction: Click on any port graph of any network device Select a From date to your liking (not earlier than the device was actually added to LNMS), and then select a future date in the To field. Click update You should now see a linear prediction line on the graph. How do I move only the DB to another server? There is already a reference how to move your whole LNMS installation to another server. But the following steps will help you to split up an \"All-in-one\" installation to one LibreNMS installation with a seperate database install. *Note: This section assumes you have a MySQL/MariaDB instance Stop the apache and mysql service in you LibreNMS installation. Edit out all the cron entries in /etc/cron.d/librenms . Dump your librenms database on your current install by issuing mysqldump librenms -u root -p > librenms.sql . Stop and disable the MySQL server on your current install. On your new server make sure you create a new database with the standard install command, no need to add a user for localhost though. Copy this over to your new database server and import it with mysql -u root -p librenms < librenms.sql . Enter to mysql and add permissions with the following two commands: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON librenms.* TO 'librenms'@'IP_OF_YOUR_LNMS_SERVER' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON librenms.* TO 'librenms'@'FQDN_OF_YOUR_LNMS_SERVER' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; exit; Enable and restart MySQL server. Edit your config.php file to point the install to the new database server location. Very important : On your LibreNMS server, inside your install directory is a .env file, in it you need to edit the DBHOST paramater to point to your new server location. After all this is done, enable all the cron entries again and start apache.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Support/FAQ/#getting-started","text":"How do I install LibreNMS? How do I add a device?

We have enabled support for setting a maximum value for rrd files for ports. Before this all rrd files were set to 100G max values, now you can enable support to limit this to the actual port speed. rrdtool tune will change the max value when the interface speed is detected as being changed (min value will be set for anything 10M or over) or when you run the included script (./scripts/tune_port.php) - see RRDTune doc SNMP ifInOctets and ifOutOctets are counters, which means they start at 0 (at device boot) and count up from there. LibreNMS records the value every 5 minutes and uses the difference between the previous value and the current value to calculate rate. (Also, this value resets to 0 when it hits the max value) Now, when the value is not recorded for awhile RRD (our time series storage) does not record a 0, it records the last value, otherwise, there would be even worse problems. Then finally we get the current ifIn/OutOctets value and record that. Now, it appears as though all of the traffic since it stopped getting values have occurred in the last 5 minute interval.

So here are some ways you can help LibreNMS improve. Code. This is a big thing. We want this community to grow by the software developing and evolving to cater for users needs. The biggest area that people can help make this happen is by providing code support. This doesn't necessarily mean contributing code for discovering a new device: Web UI, a new look and feel has been adopted but we are not finished by any stretch of the imagination. Make suggestions, find and fix bugs, update the design / layout. Poller / Discovery code. Improving it (we think a lot can be done to speed things up), adding new device support and updating old ones. The LibreNMS main website, this is hosted on GitHub like the main repo and we accept use contributions here as well :) Hardware. We don't physically need it but if we are to add device support, it's made a whole lot easier with access to the kit via SNMP. If you've got MIBs, they are handy as well :) If you know the vendor and can get permission to use logos that's also great. Bugs. Found one? We want to know about it. Most bugs are fixed after being spotted and reported by someone, I'd love to say we are amazing developers and will fix all bugs before you spot them but that's just not true. Feature requests. Can't code / won't code. No worries, chuck a feature request into our community forum with enough detail and someone will take a look. A lot of the time this might be what interests someone, they need the same feature or they just have time. Please be patient, everyone who contributes does so in their own time. Documentation. Documentation can always be improved and every little bit helps. Not all features are currently documented or documented well, there's speeling mistakes etc. It's very easy to submit updates through the GitHub website , no git experience needed. Be nice, this is the foundation of this project. We expect everyone to be nice. People will fall out, people will disagree but please do it so in a respectable way. Ask questions.

The suggestions are in a rough order of how much impact they will have. RRDCached We absolutely recommend running this, it will save on IO load . RRDCached MySQL Optimisation It's advisable after 24 hours of running MySQL that you run MySQL Tuner which will make suggestions on things you can change specific to your setup. One recommendation we can make is that you set the following in my.cnf under a [mysqld] group: innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0 You can also set this to 2. This will have the possibility that you could lose up to 1 second on mysql data in the event MySQL crashes or your server does but it provides an amazing difference in IO use. Polling modules Review the graph of poller module time take under gear > pollers > performance to see what modules are consuming poller time. This data is shown per device under device > graphs > poller. Disable polling (and discovery) modules that you do not need. You can do this globally in config.php like: Disable OSPF polling $config [ 'poller_modules' ][ 'ospf' ] = false ; You can disable modules globally then re-enable the module per device or the opposite way. For a list of modules please see Poller modules SNMP Max Repeaters We have support for SNMP Max repeaters which can be handy on devices where we poll a lot of ports or bgp sessions for instance and where snmpwalk or snmpbulkwalk is used. This needs to be enabled on a per device basis under edit device -> snmp -> Max repeaters. You can also set this globally with the config option $config['snmp']['max_repeaters'] = X; . It's advisable to test the time taken to snmpwalk IF-MIB or something similar to work out what the best value is. To do this run the following but replace -REPEATERS- with varying numbers from 10 upto around 50. You will also need to set the correct snmp version, hostname and community string: time snmpbulkwalk -v2c -cpublic HOSTNAME -Cr-REPEATERS- -M /opt/librenms/mibs -m IF-MIB IfEntry NOTE: Do not go blindly setting this value as you can impact polling negatively. SNMP Max OIDs For sensors polling we now do bulk snmp gets to speed things up. By default this is ten but you can overwrite this per device under edit device -> snmp -> Max OIDs. You can also set this globally with the config option $config['snmp']['max_oid'] = X; . NOTE: It is advisable to monitor sensor polling when you change this to ensure you don't set the value too high. fping tuning You can change some of the default fping options used globally or per device. The defaults are: $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'timeout' ] = 500 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'count' ] = 3 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'interval' ] = 500 ; If your devices are slow to respond then you will need to increase the timeout value and potentially the interval value. However if your network is stable, you can increase poller performance by dropping the count value to 1 and/or the timeout+millsec value to 200 or 300: $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'timeout' ] = 300 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'count' ] = 1 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'interval' ] = 300 ; This will mean that we no longer delay each icmp packet sent (we send 3 in total by default) by 0.5 seconds. With only 1 icmp packet being sent then we will receive a response quicker. The defaults mean it will take at least 1 second for a response no matter how quick the icmp packet is returned. Optimise poller-wrapper The default 16 threads that poller-wrapper.py runs as isn't necessarily the optimal number. A general rule of thumb is 2 threads per core but we suggest that you play around with lowering / increasing the number until you get the optimal value. Note KEEP in MIND that this doesn't always help, it depends on your system and CPU. So be careful. This can be changed by going to the cron job for librenms. Usually in /etc/cron.d/librenms and changing the \"16\" */5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/cronic /opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 16 Please also see Dispatcher Service Recursive DNS If your install uses hostnames for devices and you have quite a lot then it's advisable to setup a local recursive dns instance on the LibreNMS server. Something like pdns-recursor can be used and then configure /etc/resolv.conf to use 127.0.0.1 for queries. Per port polling - experimental By default the polling ports module will walk ifXEntry + some items from ifEntry regardless of the port. So if a port is marked as deleted because you don't want to see them or it's disabled then we still collect data. For the most part this is fine as the walks are quite quick. However for devices with a lot of ports and good % of those are either deleted or disabled then this approach isn't optimal. So to counter this you can enable 'selected port polling' per device within the edit device -> misc section or by globally enabling it ( not recommended ): $config['polling']['selected_ports'] = true; . This is truly not recommended, as it has been proven to affect cpu usage of your poller negatively. You can also set it for a specific OS: $config['os']['ios']['polling']['selected_ports'] = true; . Running ./scripts/collect-port-polling.php will poll your devices with both full and selective polling, display a table with the difference and optionally enable or disable selected ports polling for devices which would benefit from a change. Note that it doesn't continously re-evaluate this, it will only be updated when the script is run. There are a number of options: -h <device id> | <device hostname wildcard> Poll single device or wildcard hostname -e <percentage> Enable/disable selected ports polling for devices which would benefit <percentage> from a change If you want to run this script to have it set selected port polling on devices where a change of 10% or more is evaluated , run it with ./scripts/collect-port-polling.php -e 10 . But note: it will not blindly use only the 10%. There is a second condition that the change has to be more than one second in polling time. Web interface HTTP/2 If you are running https then you should enable http/2 support in whatever web server you use: For Nginx (1.9.5 and above) change listen 443 ssl; to listen 443 ssl http2; in the Virtualhost config. For Apache (2.4.17 an above) set Protocols h2 http/1.1 in the Virtualhost config. PHP-opcache A lot of performance can be gained from setting up php-opcache correctly. Note: Memory based caching with PHP cli will increase memory usage and slow things down. File based caching is not as fast as memory based and is more likely to have stale cache issues. Some distributions allow seperate cli, mod_php and php-fpm configurations, we can use this to set the optimal config. For web servers using mod_php and php-fpm Update your web PHP opcache.ini. Possible locations: /etc/php/7.2/fpm/conf.d/opcache.ini , /etc/php.d/opcache.ini , or /etc/php/conf.d/opcache.ini zend_extension=opcache opcache.enable=1 opcache.memory_consumption=256 If you are having caching issues, you can clear the opcache by simply restarting httpd or php-fpm.

Create your main configuration file: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc.conf Name = monitoring AddressFamily = ipv4 Device = /dev/net/tun Next we need network up- and down scripts to define a few network settings for inside our VPN: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-up #!/bin/sh ifconfig $INTERFACE 10 .6.1.1 netmask 255 .255.255.0 ip route add 10 .6.1.1/24 dev $INTERFACE ip route add 10 .0.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE ip route add 10 .100.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE ip route add 10 .200.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE In this example we have 10.6.1.1 as the VPN IP address for the monitoring server on a /24 subnet. $INTERFACE will be automatically substituted with the name of the VPN, \"myvpn\" in this case. Then we have a route for the VPN subnet, so we can reach other sites via their VPN address. The last 3 lines designate the remote subnets. In the example I want to reach devices on three different remote private /22 subnets and be able to monitor devices on them from this server, so I set up routes for each of those remote sites in my tinc-up script. The tinc-down script is relatively simple as it just removes the custom interface, which should get rid of the routes as well: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-down #!/bin/sh ifconfig $INTERFACE down Make sure your scripts scan be executed: chmod +x /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-* As a last step we need a host configuration file. This should be named the same as the \"Name\" you defined in tinc.conf: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring Subnet = 10 .6.1.1/32 On the monitoring server we will just fill in the subnet and not define its external IP address to make sure it listens on all available external interfaces. It's time to use tinc to create our key-pair: tincd -n myvpn -K Now the file /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring should have an RSA public key appended to it and your private key should reside in /etc/tinc/myvpn/rsa_key.priv . To make sure that the connection will be restored after each reboot, you can add your VPN name to /etc/tinc/nets.boot . Now you can start tinc with tincd -n myvpn and it will listen for your remote sites to connect to it. Remote site configuration Essentially the same steps as for your central monitoring server apply for all remote gateway devices. These can be routers, or just any computer or VM running on the remote subnet, able to reach the internet with the ability to forward IP packets externally. Install tinc Create directory structure: mkdir -p /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts Create main configuration: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc.conf Name = remote1 AddressFamily = ipv4 Device = /dev/net/tun ConnectTo = monitoring Create up script: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-up #!/bin/sh ifconfig $INTERFACE 10 .6.1.2 netmask 255 .255.255.0 ip route add 10 .6.1.2/32 dev $INTERFACE Create down script: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-down #!/bin/sh ifconfig $INTERFACE down Make executable: chmod +x /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc* Create device configuration: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/remote1 Address = 198 .51.100.2 Subnet = 10 .0.0.0/22 This defines the device IP address outside of the VPN and the subnet it will expose. Copy over the monitoring server's host configuration (including the embedded public key) and add it's external IP address: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring Address = 203 .0.113.6 Subnet = 10 .6.1.1/32 -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY----- VeDyaqhKd4o2Fz... Generate this device's keys: tincd -n myvpn -K Copy over this devices host file including the embedded public key to your monitoring server. Add the name for the VPN to /etc/tinc/nets.boot if you want to autostart the connection upon reboot. Start tinc: tincd -n myvpn These steps can basically be repeated for every remote site just choosing different names and other internal IP addresses. In my case I connected 3 remote sites running behind Ubiquiti EdgeRouters. Since those devices let me install software through Debian's package management it was very easy to set up. Just create the necessary configuration files and network scripts on each device and distribute the host configurations including the public keys to each device that will actively connect back. Now you can add all devices you want to monitor in LibreNMS using their internal IP address on the remote subnets or using some form of name resolution. I opted to declare the most important devices in my /etc/hosts file on the monitoring server. As an added bonus tinc is a mesh VPN, so in theory you could specify several \"ConnectTo\" on each device and they should hold connections even if one network path goes down.","title":"Remote Monitoring VPN"},{"location":"Support/Remote-Monitoring-VPN/#remote-monitoring-using-tinc-vpn","text":"This article describes how to use tinc to connect several remote sites and their subnets to your central monitoring server.

The problem with this card is that the implementation is based on the final manufacturer of the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) and not based on a standard given by Carel. So each pCOweb card has a different configuration that needs a different MIB depending on the manufacturer implementation. The main problem is that LibreNMS will discover this card as pCOweb and not as your real manufacturer like it should. A solution was found to bypass this issue, but it's LibreNMS independent and you need to first configure your pCOWeb through the admin interface. Configuring the pCOweb card SNMP for LibreNMS First you need to configure your SNMP card using the admin interface. An SNMP tab in the configuration menu leaves you the choice to choose a System OID. This is a little tricky but based on this information we defined a \"standard\" for all implementation of Carel products with LibreNMS. The base Carel OID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.9839. To this OID we will add the final manufacturer Enterprise OID. You can find all enterprise OID following this link . This will allow us to create a specific support for this device.
